His customer service was professional, patient, knowledgable, and took time to explain things to me. I give him an A+ Excellent technical skill, knowledge, and customer service. Very patient and understanding. This experience was outstanding! This is top level service and should be rewarded! Thank you!!!!!!!!!

This was an intensive process which took several sessions and required expert technical knowledge. Aniruddh showed patience, understanding, and exemplified perfectly what customer service and customer success should look like! He is a brilliant engineer and people-person. Give him a raise and a promotion! Folders appear to be syncing with OneDrive. Thank you! Rahul was excellent. Although we determined that the issue may be hardware related (and therefore, I will need to bring my Surface Book 2 and docking station into a Microsoft Store), Rahul was very thorough in checking my windows and making sure that my docking station was updated to the latest software. Great service! Excellent knowledge of Microsoft products and services, especially Outlook. She helped me add 2 new emails for my employees and was very polite! Fantastic service! Hello. Eric was vitally important to the effectiveness of my work week! He resolved the issue I had been having with Microsoft Word. He did some troubleshooting with me, then ran a repair office for the Office suite, and that corrected the problem. He followed up with me several times via email and called back the next day to ensure my issue was resolved. Thank you once again, Eric! Ishan was EXCELLENT in providing help in resolving my ticket! He fixed my document upload/sync problem with great customer service skills and he was efficient. Thank you! The agent provided exceptionally great service today! He helped me configure two new mailboxes, and he did it professionally and with great courtesy! Excellent knowledge and customer service! Give this man a promotion!\n",

I did not know much about it and he was very patient and got me through to a solution.  I am very appreciative. Your agent was quite helpful, patient, and knowledgeable.  My problem with redundant outlook programs was solved and office 365 is working well.  He did an excellent job. Chris did an excellent job troubleshooting and correcting my poroblem. Adrian spent a good deal of time solving the problems that have developed over the past months with the Office 365 and the conflicts created by earlier installations.  He was knowledgeable and patient as he went through the analysis of the Office 365 business program issues and helped me get it operating again once it was reinstalled.  It was great work and I appreciate it. I needed help to ensure that cancelling a redundant OneDrive for Business would not affect the remaining data in my Business Premium account.  Bernard had to call me several times due to difficulties with my computer on my end.  He was very attentive and followed up on the calls and when he succeeded in reaching me he was patient and thorough in dealing with the need to sync my remaining onedrive to the off line program.  He did a very good job despite the need to call me several times, tolerate my having to disconnect, and then calling again to be certain he took care of the problem. Yusa did an excellent job solving my problems with Outlook, OneDrive and OneNote.  My computer based programs were not syncing and I could not troubleshoot it myself.  She was extremely helpful and conscientious if pursuing the  solution to all of the problems.  I am very happy to have worked with her on the project.

      "Michael and I both had to put our heads together to figure this issue out!!!  The Audit log was not showing actions that I had taken and the answer was, since the files were stored in One-Drive to begin with, they were NOT moved or uploaded like one would think.  Since the files were located within OneDrive and were &#8220;uploaded&#8221; to a Document Library within SharePoint, the action is NOT Upload or Moved.  It is under the &#8220;Synchronization Activities&#8221; and is considered a &quot;Uploaded Files to Document Library&quot; as the action!  This made a huge difference in how I can look at the Audit process!  Thanks to Michael I now understand this well enough that I truly feel that I can provide the necessary audit needed to protect our employee HR files! Kristelle did a great job helping me restrict who can create new Teams. Karla did a good job Just needed the link to the https://support.microsoft.com/en-ae/help/256385/xweb-creating-folders-with-special-characters-in-the-name-is-not-allow location.  When I typed in the issue in the Need Help (before I opened a ticket), is sent me to a way different area. The issue was not with Microsoft, it was with out other third party desktop support company. I sent all the messages for the errors the external users were getting.  We resolved it by him using Chrome, but your support people never did figure it out. Did a fine job!

Most people I spoke with did not actually understand my issues. they could not answer basic questions like, \"Can I get support for my issue?\" The one person who did understand, was not the right person to help.\n",

He also tested in his system and confirmed the Activity Results confirmed the user wasn&#39;t able to reset their password.  Thank you for taking the time to explain everything to me. I would give even more stars if possible. Daniyel was very helpful in finding the cause of this issue and showing me how to sign out this user from all devices - through the OneDrive Sign out.  I appreciate all his work and research. Qalia was wonderful.  We were able to successfully change the conflict settings on three Resource Rooms and verify two others already had the correct settings set to false.  Thank you very much!

Today I was able to get a better idea on how to create a site to share with external users. This will greatly benefit our business with external contributors. Balazs always does a great job ensuring the problem was resolved, and that it is working properly. He does a great job answering questions and explaining the tools and technologies that Microsoft offers in a very professional manner.  Thank you Balazs! Rep was very helpful and did a great job helping me figure out what was wrong and how to add my user on to our new site. Thanks! :) Reps so far at Office365 are really good!! Rep was helpful in guiding me how this Need Help works for specific times. I needed someone to call us at 11 AM EST. But he advised me well on what to do so that someone could call us at that time. Thank you :) Rep was helpful and eased my concerned that site name should not affect the overall content. Advised to look into the other PC perhaps there is the problem. Melvin Craft to be exact! Was just amazing. He was very patient and supportive. He was able to help me and the external users get on board to the SharePoint site that were trying to organize and have set up. He was very professional and knew how to answer questions effectively and telling us what differences there are and what is needed for specific products/access. Overall great guy hope to speak to him again when we need him, just a great rep! Thanks Melvin Craft! :) Good job in helping us thanks Adam was very helpful and resolved our OneDrive issue. We had to reschedule to continue fixing the issue and Adam was on time ready to get this done. Now our user is back on track. Thanks Adam for your help and patience! :) Rep was really helpful. We walked through a powershell script together to get our Focused Inbox option on. We hope to see it in a couple of hours. Overall good experience, he was patient and knew exactly what we wanted and needed to get this to work. Thank you! Rep was friendly, patient, and very helpful. He assured me that the licenses were renewed and helped me on my sharepoint question. He also helped receiving a feedback from a prior rep on a prior case. Thanks! Representative called on time. Was very helpful and patient with my issue and question. I am glad we were able to detect a phishing scam going to my work email. Hope it gets a further look so that it can be stopped!

However, the only resolution available for my problem is to cancel a meeting and send a new invitation in order to add additional people. Our committee membership changes frequently and I need a more flexible solution or this will quickly become a real hassle. Jen was very helpful and patient in helping us to resolve our syncing issue. I spent more than 30 minutes dealing with this issue this morning. The second rep who contacted me discovered that this is a known issue with a workaround and we had it fixed within 10 minutes.

Personally, I feel OneDrive, OneDrive for Business &amp; Sharepoint syncing, and their relationships to one another is terribly confusing and they are great when they work, but when they don&#39;t they are terrible to troubleshoot/fix. Too much confusion w/ OneDrive could eventually drive customers to a different solution (like Dropbox) it would be nice to be able to store SharePoint files in other than OneDrive.

      "Great job, again!  MS support is great.  Zeah did a great job! Excellent job as a always - batting 1,000 so far! Good service again! Michael did a great job on the phone and via email to help me with a Sharepoint extranet site.  Five stars to him. However, the setup and administration for the Sharepoint site are just too complicated and time consuming for companies like ours without a dedicated IT team.  Box or Dropbox are better alternatives for what we need to do. Nice job.  My computer didn't cooperate about the problems I submitted... John did a great job of explaining sharing and persmissions in OneDrive! Alexander was very friendly and helpful, just like all of your support folks.  Keep up the good work. Nino did a great job walking me through the process of creating a user alias.  I like the screen share option where the engineer can mark up the screen.  That&#39;s a good visual that I&#39;ll be able to remember in the future. Documents saved in Word on a Mac do not appear the same in Word on a PC. The PC seems to be substituting different fonts for the ones used by the Mac, despite the fact that the proper fonts are present on the PC. The PC even reports that it is using the correct fonts, but does not display them.  It substitutes Times New Roman. Great job! Very friendly and helpful. An amazing fellow! Mark did a great job in resolving this issue.  It took a while because, apparently, the documentation at Microsoft is a little lacking.  However, Mark stuck with it, kept me informed of progress along the way and worked with my crazy schedule so we could get together again for the resolution.  Nice job Mark! Reuben did a great job - very patient until we got to the root of the problem. Michael did a great job.  Promptly found an answer and problem was resolved.  Great work! Great job, Agata!\n",

Matt seems to be a very excellent support agent. I become available to work with this issue again today at about the time that Matt leaves his shift. So I will rather reach out to another agent when it suits me. I also want to share with another agent the recommendations that Matt has sent me to get another opinion. Thanks again for always being available. Good job, thank you. Kenneth responded well. But as I was already speaking to another agent about the issue, I did not required a duplication of two agents checking into the question. So I decided to pursue my above question with the other agent. This agent was VERY helpful to investigate my problem that I was not being called back by the agent on ticket #6912257. &#10;Thank you Thank you for your good support. Super helpful and gracious! The engineer does not seem have enough experience or knowledge. &#10;Also I&#39;m not sure what happened in the end of our conversation, the line was suddenly dropped or else he just abruptly hung up!&#10;I&#39;d like to close this ticket though and I understand that not everyone has the same skills as others. No worries, have a great day! Very helpful tech! Thank you! Hamish Uhlig has been very helpful to address the issues. Thank you. Good help, thank you. Good tech!! Your agent needs to have more skills.. Too long for an agent to call me back. Thank you for the extensive and thorough help you have provided! Too long of a wait time for the agent to call me back. The agent did well, but it took way to long to reach an agent in the beginning! Very good support!! Richard has helped me so efficiently with any questions I had about OneDrive and the popup security question I was getting with Outlook. It all took him only less than 30 minutes!! I&#39;m so thankful for his professional assistance! He did a very good job and I&#39;m glad for the security I can get from your team! Very good assistance! Thanks again for the fast excellent supports! Very excellent engineer. Thanks for researching the issue and calling me back in the time that you said that you would. &#10;If this screen would allow me, I would click on 10 STAR rating! Good help! Very supportive agent! Thanks Matt for taking this ticket over again and finishing it through! The other issue with OneDrive etc. was actually completed as a different ticket. So yes, Matt is a very dedicated / experienced engineer that should be recognized for his abilities to work very well with his clients! Thank you all for your excellent support. Marc is a VERY GOOD technician!!! Matthew is the most knowledgeable, good natured, and helpful technician out there! He has incredible experience and skills as it relates to dealing with other peoples troubles when working with Office 365! I am thankful for the support!

The technician was courteous and helped me to the best of his ability, however he could not provide us with what we really need. We need external sharing report/ing enabled in SharePoint for specific sites. Data security is very important to us and we need visibility in order to implement it. If someone is sharing a site/folder with external users (and shouldn't be), we should be able to easily find that out so that we can stop the access; currently, this doesn't exist. The audit logs contain a ton of information, which can be helpful, but not what we're specifically looking for. I'm aware that external sharing reports are in development for OneDrive, we desperately need them for SharePoint; I think any administrator would agree. Also, on the Microsoft Office 365 UserVoice Forums, we need moderators to consolidate ideas because a lot of times the same idea gets posted and it doesn't get votes, which means Microsoft won't look at it. Please enable external sharing reports for SharePoint\n",

Thank you! Superb service in every way.  Thank you. Dipti &amp; Varun did a terrific job of fixing what was apparently a complex issue with shared mailbox delegation.  They were patient with my terrible typing and slow mind.  Please thank them for me. Des diligently followed up and resolved the issues which had become very annoying.  Thank you! The support I received was excellent.  But it made it quite clear that OneDrive is incapable of being used reliably for any relatively large number of files that would require any more storage than a USB thumb drive could hold.  The advertised storage capacity of 1TB is deceptive and even dangerous for any customer to rely on, especially since connections between the local drive and cloud are unstable and unreliable. Mazer was very helpful and patient with me.  Please thank him for his assistance. Dale was extraordinarily helpful.  He quickly understood what I wanted to do, briefly went offline to research a solution, then came back to me and patiently guided me through successfully implementing what will be a very convenient way to use OneDrive.  Please convey  my thanks to him. Madz was very  helpful and patient.  Thank you!!! Dash was very helpful and took extra time to research the issue and then called me back to solve the problem.  Please express my thanks to him. Syed was very patient and helpful and we accomplished what we set out to do.  Thank you.

There is no workaround in MS Teams so will need to Use Skype for Business.  Looking forward to MS Teams becoming fully functional.

Choices are Sharepoint Calendar App on Team site or Group Site and Outlook Calendar (we also use MS Teams). I learned the difference between Shared and Group calendars and resolved that we should use Outlook Calendar rather than Sharepoint Calendar App because the Sharepoint app doesn't have the required functionality.

Often support agents want to answer just a specific question and shy away from complicated problems that have many layers.  Michael stuck with us and helped us resolve shared contacts and merge issues that had been plaguing us for over a year. In the process we learned how to use features in 365 like OneDrive and collaborate on documents.

I would prefer to give the feedback after I have proved that the fix has worked and the technician has signed off rather than being watched which puts pressure on to give five stars. Every employee does the best they can. Very happy Andy did a great job going through all the alternative answers. The problem must lie in the Todoist app itself. He gave me instructions on what to say to them. Conor was very helpful and solved both problems very quickly. Though at first Shelley seemed a little hesitant with the procedure, I believe that she solved the problem. I remain a little uncertain as to whether I should have put the number of the server in the SPF record. Michael was very helpful. Eventually we worked out that Eset was blocking OneDrive, so we had to suspend Eset. I hope to work with Eset to solve the problem. Great help. Thanks a lot. I would appreciate it if you could increase the size of files allowed on OneDrive for Business, please as it would mean that it could accommodate my business needs. Otherwise I have to use Dropbox.

Shrey&#39;s extensive knowledge of the many puzzle pieces solved the problem expertly and efficiently.  Awesome support Valerie was great to work with!  As I needed to migrate from one portal to another, the complex steps were clearly defined and Valerie&#39;s guidance and direction were exceptionally well done.   Valerie had a clear understanding of all aspects, domains, SharePoint, OneDrive, OneNote and more.  Amazing levels of product knowledge were demonstrated.

Although the team did not have expertise in this area, they searched for an answer & provided me with the results of their research, plus they sent me the contact information for the section which does have expertise in this area. The tech support rep quickly identified my problem and very quickly showed me how to fix it. The issue was resolved, however I am not sure why there was a problem syncing to OneDrive to begin with. I am not receiving call-backs when the support person says they will get back to me.  I am not being given a number so I can call to get the problem resolved.  Essentially, I wait and wait...and nothing happens.\n",

      "I am constantly saving files and have alot of customers.  Sometimes One Drive will consider a file to be modified only once -- when it is created. other times it will consider a file to be modified if something in a file is changed within it.  Considering a file modified based upon only when it is first created is not very helpful, If you are constantly goin in and out of OneDrive it is so much more helpful to have the sequencing based soley on changes in a file and not when it is first created.  If you make this change -- it will make the system far more efficient and user friendly -- saving hours of time for me.  It will also be nice to have that consistency.  Thanks! The software seems to be working fine.  I haven&#39;t had enough training to rate the software appropriately.\n",

      "First, let me say that Andrew Jordan was superb.  He was able to resolve my OneDrive sharing issue almost immediately and then worked with me for almost an hour on the phone and I don&#39;t know how long off the phone to see if there was a resolution to be had for the Outlook issue.  The failure to resolve my Outlook issue is a weakness in the software NOT because of Andrew, whose support was exemplary. Chrysi was awesome.  She remained calm while I vented about a problem and then stayed the course until the end to make certain my problem was resolved.  She is a credit to your organization. John was a great help to my problem. He was able to identify the problem through extraneous troubleshoots and was able to offer the best solution. He was patient with me, empathetic when I had frustrations, and diligent to figure out the source of my problem. I would highly recommend John as customer service representative for any future assistance with Microsoft. Please update the support article to provide a solution that works instead of requiring me to submit a service request. After almost 75 days, I finally was able to get this problem resolved thanks to Liam, who, in about 35 minutes was able to walk me through a very simple process that, if followed by the engineer assigned to Ticket #11845391, would have prevented the horrific problems we have experienced since then. The ONLY issue was the phone connection.  Otherwise, Hammad was superb. Our office has been struggling with certain aspects of our Office 365 resources since some time in October of last year.  I have had four or five different ambassadors working on a sequence of related problems.  It seems Jay was finally able to resolve all of my concerns, and I appreciate very much his patience and willingness to walk me through various aspects of how everything works together in Office 365.  I would definitely recommend him as a support Ambassador! Nikki was very patient and helpful. She was awesome!\n",

I added a spam policy excepting the email address and domain. I was also having trouble accessing Skype and Teams meetings, so we took a look at different options for that. The engineer transferred my call to the Windows 10 automated system. NOT OKAY! I still have a workstation locked up due to either an Office 365 or Windows 10 error, and need to get it resolved ASAP. Very helpful conversation on recommended settings to help block spam and phishing. Thank you! Aazim zeroed right in on add-ins as the probable cause. We removed a couple, and voila! Outlook opened as expected. This was a very quick call with fast, efficient service. I just had a few quick questions which Ryan answered. Great service, as usual. Judy did a great job. She answered my questions and helped me gain a better understanding of admin functions for Office 365. Wensley did a great job fixing the issues and answering my questions. Ivan checked a couple of things and had me restart. The repair and update seem to have fixed the issue. Tech support took care to understand the problem. My original support tech needed to replicate the issue and get more info, but called back as promised with another engineer who was able to walk me through how to resolve the issue, plus showed me how to use STEPS to record/remember what we did for future use. Great job! Asad was very pleasant and easy to work with. Unfortunately, Microsoft&#39;s help portal was down, so it took a 2nd call to get the email issue resolved. The OneDrive issue resolved itself. Snigdh Singh was pleasant and helpful. We got the issue resolved and I learned a little more about how to configure things to get what we want.\n",

      "I am very happy with the service provided by Sayed.  Most importantly, he solved my problem.  Another Office 365 tech had tried to fix it yesterday, and thought he did, but I had the same problem again today.  Sayed tried different things, and even while we had hung up waiting for a sync to finish, he continued to do research and found the answer to the problem.  He really stuck with it and went the extra mile.  He was also very quick, explained things very clearly, and was a pleasure to work with.  I was very frustrated before he called, and he made me a happy Office 365 customer! Harold was very helpful.  Although I requested help on a certain matter - setting up OneDrive on my computer, he spent a lot of time with me explaining various things.  I have been using Office 365/OneDrive for years, but he showed me several important things that are very useful to me and that I had no knowledge of.  Harold was very patient and friendly, in addition to being knowledgeable and quickly understanding the issues and coming up with answers and solutions.  Thank you. Dilbagh was very helpful, stayed with my complicated issues, called me back several times, and solved all my current issues.  He was very courteous and I am very happy with his service. Via was very helpful.  She had great suggestions.  We did a little trouble shooting and then she recommended that I first get my corrupted Windows system files fixed by the Windows team.  It turned out that was definitely the best thing to do, and I am thankful that she was knowledgeable and clever enough to know for me to do that.  She also was very diligent in following up with me, emailing and calling, and was very pleasant to work with.  I was very happy with Via's service.  Thank you Nishant was very good.  He stayed with the issue, researched what he needed to do when he needed to research, called me back quickly and when he said he would, worked quickly and efficiently, and solved my issue.  And he was courteous and very pleasant to deal with. This has nothing to do with Nishant, but I do have an issue with the new Recover Deleted Items folder.  If I recover a previous version of a Task, it replaces the newer version, and the newer version disappears and is not recoverable.  I wish we could choose to keep the newer version after recovering and viewing the older version.  Thank you I am very very happy with the service and help I received from Frey. I requested help to install Office 365 on my new computer. I have used Office 365 for many years. Before starting the installation I had some questions. Frey answered all of my questions and was very knowledgeable. I have contacted Office 365 many times over the years, and Frey was the best of everyone. Knowledgeable, friendly, smart and creative. He explained things so that I was able to understand so many things about the various apps of Office 365 that no one has been able to fully explain to me, and made everything clear and simple. And he was patient. Spent over 3 hours with me answering my questions and explaining in detail. The actual installation went very quickly. Separately, I have a couple of requests for things that Microsoft does not provide. I use Tasks in Outlook extensively in managing my business. I need a mobile app that manages Tasks with regular features like sorting, search, etc. Thank you I am very unhappy with the service from Office 365. The engineer was not able to solve my problem. He did not know how to solve it, and could not even answer my questions. But he refused to let me speak to someone else who might be able to help me, like a supervisor or someone with more experience or more senior. After two days of dealing with this person I asked to close this ticket even though this was not resolved because I did not want to waste any more of my time dealing with this person who is not able to help me. Sajeel was very very good and I am very happy with his service.  He worked with me for hours, literally, and solved my problem. We primarily worked on the Outlook Search issue which another Office 365 support person had been trying to fix for two days and could not fix it.  Sajeel was great.  He was very fast, explained very well and clearly, was creative in looking for solutions, and was very nice and patient.\n",

      "Kakombe once again fixed our issue quickly and perfectly!! No resolution was found after weeks of back and forth. Very frustrating! Kakombe Funga-Mukaba was the most helpful tech I&#39;ve ever worked with. Not only did he fix my issue, he explained what was happening so that if others in my office encounter the same issue, I will know how to resolve it without having to call in a ticket. Promote him or give him a raise! Jacob was diligent and found the resolution after a coupe tries. Was very pleasant to work with! Dissatisfied with OneDrive and all of the syncing issues. Extremely satisfied with the assistance provided by Kakombe!\n",

Cathy was a pleasure to work with. I appreciate her researching my issue and getting back in touch with me to let me know there was no solution to my issue. I would like to share that Microsoft encourages the use of SharePoint for shared files, especially for small teams (which we are). It is a significant flaw that we can not attach SP files directly in outlook for the web when working outside the office, only OneDrive. Wonderful help, thanks so much!\n",

      "I was a frustrated Office365 Admin lost in the weeds of non-applicable documentation on Sat. morn when I called. Thanks to Daniel, now on Monday at his follow-up call, I am an enthusiastic Office365 Admin, ready to take on all challenges!  As an Office365 business customer since 2013, I had not realized that I had such extensive phone support. I am thankful that Daniel was my technical support contact because he was patient and worked with me to do some scary things. I was afraid that an older OneDrive (personal) and older OneDrive (business) had been lost forever. He discovered that I was not using the full features of the Off354 E3 license and helped me expand my horizons.  I've used Windows since its beginnings and this is the first time I've had the confidence that I was not missing something important. Whew!  My all-time best technical support experience in 50 years of computing. I wil setup OneDrives for others now! Please  reward Daniel and keep him working for Microsoft!  Alice Excellent support from Kevin!  I also want to note how much I like the new Admin Center, Dynamics365 and PowerApps!\n",

      "A ajuda prestada pelo atendente Valter foi excelente, rápida e esclarecedora. Mesmo assim, algumas limitações do OneDrive e Sharepoint dificultam algumas coisas. Como sugestão, 1. o sistema deveria indexar rapidamente os novos itens, sem a necessidade de forçar ou aguardar algumas horas; 2 o wild card deveria funcionar para substrings, e 3. se existe uma limitação de itens que podem ser encontrados por vez (SQL), ao menos liberem a busca dentro de uma pasta específica para limitar este número.  PS 4. Um sistema de tags (como no Evernote ou como é no sistema de Fotos do OneDrive Pessoal, como as categorias nos emails do Outlook) iria facilitar muito as referencias e pesquisas cruzadas. Procurar itens apenas por pastas é muito antigo e limitado. Sei que falar é fácil, rs, mas seria algo realmente útil e colocaria vocês na frente dos concorrentes. Principalemente para empresas como nós que guardamos inúmeras referências, isso seria um grande diferencial. Isso vale também pro OneNote.\n",

      "I had Carlos on a previous call. Once again he provided excellent support and was very courteous and understanding of the limitations of the technology. We developed a best pactice that should enable us to use Office 365 (web) in concert with the desktop version of Outlook. OneDrive is a flawed and inadequate product for the enterprise. My 35 users can't save to my shared folders from all apps. The OneDrive icon propogates in the File Explorer when you switch the default storage location. Your first level techs do not know how to resolve the issue. Furthermore, the admin tools are completely inadequate, especially for error checking and resolution of file transfer problems. I'm done with OneDrive and am evaluating other solutions like Citrix ShareFile. We were unable to replicate the problem, but the tech did all that she could at this point. If the problem with being logged out of Office 365 happens again we are to take a screen shot and report any error codes. So the mystery continues, but it&#39;s not the tech&#39;s fault. He provided excellent support to help us update our spam filters and reporting. I could not have done this without his assistance. Thank you very much!!!! 3 days of back and forth phone calls and &quot;research&quot; only to be told that configuring Windows 10 and Office 365 with an iPhone was out of scope for the help services. I asked that on day 1. A waste of time for everyone involved. Excellent The tech was very patient and helpful in resolving our problems. I appreciate her efforts very much. Jay, the tech support person, was very helpful and patient with me. He also answered another unrelated question quickly for me. A real support super hero to me today. Thanks. Prompt response and the issue seemed to have resolved itself with Saifuddin's help which is always nice. Very helpful, patient and informative. Excellent support leading me through some Power Shell scripts to correct some issues with a Sharedmail box that were not operating correctly. very helpful As an Admin, there is no way to enable syncing &quot;Files On-Demand&quot; globally for my 36 users. Instead, I must configure this feature at each users workstation. This is not an acceptable solution. There should be a way to set as a default &quot;Files On-Demand&quot;. We have hundreds of gigabytes of info that will tie up their computers and network bandwith. Also, I don&#39;t have the capability to configure computers that are remotely located before they try setting up OneDrive on their own. The rep was very efficient and helpful in answering all of my questions quickly. Outstanding support. Davey stayed with me on the phone for well over 1.25 hours to resolve this ticket as well as another open one that another support agent could not resolve. The rep was very patient with me and was able to resolve the issues on 2 computers very quickly. Excellent support! Dominick was very patient in helping resolve issues involving setting up a shared email box using Outlook 2016 (desktop version). He is an asset to your organization. Imran provided excellent support, helping me to resolve complicated licensing issues for MS Project Pro online. He performed his duties with patience and a high degree of knowledge. He is a real asset to Microsoft. This rep was very thorough and provided excellent follow and attention to detail. She was very thorough and patient with me to resolution of several issues. A swift and effective resolution was found with tact and candor. Very helpful Quick response. Ken worked through the inadequacies of OneDrive with me. I am satisfied with Ken&#39;s work. I am not happy or  satisfied that OneDrive is the cloud-based file sharing solution we need. The admin and error resolution tools are not sufficient or reasonable for our 35 users.

It would be nice if a restore feature similar to OneDrive was available (which I used) so an Office 365 administrator could selectively restore their data.

The representative did an excellent job explaining the ins and outs of Outlook and People. I have a better understanding of Outlook (even if I don&#39;t think it is as friendly and clean as other apps like Google Apps.) Friendly, tenacious, knowledgeable tech support that stuck with me until the issue was resolved. A fantastic amount of patience and knowledge was imparted by the Tech support (William) in resolving my issue. Thank you for the excellent support. A very patient and knowledgeable rep. Was very helpful, and helped resolve even more than the ticket asked help for. Our company is trying to convert to the full line of Microsoft apps, most importantly to Outlook and Planner, to replace our existing systems in Apple Mail, Contacts and a third-party project management system. But it seems that Microsoft Office 365 is still evolving in regards to how they work in Apple devices. (We are strictly Apple computer users.) MS needs to make a stronger effort to make your products compatible with Apple devices given that nearly a half of the U.S. now runs on Apple devices. We still cannot use Planner because of what seems to be a set of bugs still in the system. Very quick and knowledgeabler assistance. Very knowledgeable and helpful support. Resolved the issue with little effort and a lot of patience. Thank you. Fast knowledgable Getting an issue resolved has been a problem because tech support makes initial efforts to contact and, if not immediately available, the ticket gets closed. Then, if the client reopens the ticket it gets ignored. Microsoft's customer support is the best of all the accounts we hold. Two things keep us as Microsoft customers: the best Office Suite tools (Word, Excel, and PPt), and customer support like the one we just experienced. In truth, pretty much everything else is average or substandard, including OneDrive (which we use despite its many drawbacks), Teams, and all the other apps offered on O365. But Office Suite and especially customer support keep us in the O365 ecosystem instead of defecting to Google or elsewhere. A big thank you to the gentleman who just helped me with this issue. Resolved the issue very well. Thanks. Very friendly and knowledgeable rep helped resolve the issue quickly. Quick, knowledgeable support. Very helpful and patient. Got done what needed to get done. Very kind, enthusiastic and knowledgeable help. Resolved the issue with minimal effort. Very knowledgeable and effective assistance. Resolved the issue quickly. Thank you.

      "Tabitha was terrific.  I am really unhappy with Office 365 but that is no reflection on the great job she did trying to help us get it set up. Lewis is outstanding!  Excellent, knowledgeable, and patient.  If he didn't have the answer, he knew where to get it.  Extremely thorough at troubleshooting problems.  Five stars and a big thank you! The agent was very polite but really did not answer the question, which was how to set up MS OneDrive so it does not completely tie up office bandwidth? And in particular, is there really no better option than to pause syncing or stop it altogether, which then means Autosave is constantly interrupted?  He answered with instructions on how to pause and stop syncing, which I already knew.  Please pass on the fact that OneDrive taking up excessive bandwidth is very disruptive and I hope they fix it soon. I am sorry to be limited to 1000 characters to describe the exceptionally positive experience I had working with Jessy. He is the most exceptional Microsoft tech support we have ever had the pleasure of engaging with over  many years of working with MS products.  He is a great credit to Microsoft and why we remain a 100% Microsoft school. He is professional, knowledgeable, very detail-oriented, courteous, and patient with our small operation with a long list of Office 365 issues and problems to resolve. We started out frustrated that we could not figure out these solutions ourselves and cranky that we had to call tech support. We left feeling quite satisfied and grateful, having learned through Jessy's troubleshooting a great deal about Office 365 programs that to our knowledge is not available in tutorials AND helps us be much more self-sufficient going forward. If he is interested in training others, he would be an excellent choice, although a great loss to the front line. THANK YOU. The person was not able to identify the MS error codes and just recommended a clean install, which of course solves everything, but I was expecting more. The first person who called had less technical knowledge of the problem than I did.  He or she found a supervisor to help, but by then I had left on a trip.  I told them to close the case and I will call back when I am in front of the computer with the OneDrive sync problem that reduces our computers to a complete crawl. Putting sync on pause is not a solution as it really messes up synchronization.  Please fix OneDrive so it does not take up so much of the available bandwidth. Chex is terrific technical support.  I really appreciate being able to follow up with him after the ticket was closed. Outstanding and patient technical support provided on a very confusing problem with inaccurate OneDrive synchronization of personal and work accounts.  Thank you!\n",

      "He helped me get OneDrive to be provisioned and showed me how to share files securely.  Although the technology didn&#39;t work first time, he reliably called back when he said he would and solved it in the end.  He was also honest when he accidentally gave me the wrong advice on what was in E1 plan, which I appreciate knowing now.  Thanks, this is my second good experience with Microsoft in 30 years. We spent over an hour, and the problem was mostly that my domain name settings wouldn't switch over. However it would have been helpful if the person that switched me to O365 from Exchange did that at the time, instead of now.  Anyway, all sorted, thanks. very fast and helpful, thankyou thank you very bad feature that cuts off a contact if the email doesn&#39;t work, when they are logging in with a &#39;fake&#39;company email anyway.

It's the training material I was looking for. When I found the OD videos it didn't have what i was looking for. Macintosh OneDrive installation and how to use on a Mac. Paul was able to straighten out the issue we were experiencing when conference rooms would allow over booking.&#10;Awesome job!

Rich did an excellent job and really stuck with the task. We ended up having to stick with a work-around as solution rather than achieve desired functionality with OneDrive, but that appears to be a Microsoft issue, and nothing Rich could have resolved. He tried everything, and I'm very grateful for his efforts. Thank you for speedy help resolving my questions. Quick and painless Thanks for the help!

There was no documented answer so came up with a new method for transferring the mail items from my IMAP account on Mac to the new Exchange account on Mac.  I am very happy with the outcome.  He then went on to help me set up OneDrive on the Mac as well. Both Latasha and Michael have been extremely helpful in resolving this and other issues that I have had for months.  It was very reassuring to work with them both.  Thank you for being there for us.  Eva Harry was very reassuring and knowledgeable.  He confirmed for me that the actions I had taken were correct, and that future plans which I wish to implement will work.  I would highly recommend his assistance to anyone. Kenny was very polite, patient and helpful. Thank you, Joyce was most knowledgeable and helpful. Jakov was extremely patient, friendly and supportive.  We resolved the issue on 1 machine and then he helped me to do so on another.  I would highly recommend his support to any user. Thank you for your continual reliable and knowledgeable support. Drel was persistent and consistently patient and helpful. Krystal is going to email me with more information so that we can resolve the issue together. Dash was very clear in her instructions and gave me the exact links to what I needed to know.  Thanks so much for your help. Michael has been extremely helpful and clear in his instructions.  We have managed to move from POP to Exchange through his diligent and careful management.  I am excited about what the future holds and the potential that is being unlocked by this move. Although Louis didn&#39;t know all the answers, he found a solution for me to this problem.  Thank you so much for your continued support. Rueben was extremely helpful and efficient.

So that was a little disappointing that the update has meant I have to completely restart the process. However, Junel was very polite and helpful and has helped me to resolve the issue in the long run. One thing to mention is the telephone call was very delayed (lag effect) so when I said something there was a few seconds delay which I have noticed previously on support calls. I raised the request, and within 10 minutes of doing so Martin was in touch, which I was very impressed with. We didn't immediately resolve the issue because we think it is to do with propagation time, however Martin was very professional, helpful, calm and patient with me. He found a useful article which we think is the same issue we are having so we will wait up to 72 hours and see, however I am very happy with the service received today.\n",

When they did, they basically blew me off with a completely bogus answer. They said that the reason the OneDrive Admin Control Panel didn't work for me was because my primary SMTP address and LOGIN were different. That is a true fact. However, NO OTHER PART OF OFFICE 365 WORKS THIS WAY! So, that means the OneDrive Admin Control Panel is BROKEN. Customer support was very friendly, but didn't 'solve' anything.

In this case, the user got a local IT person involved which was useful, but not our own resolution. Great job! In this case, it took quite a few technicians to get someone who was able to investigate the issue and get to the root cause. Keith was tenacious and I appreciate that he found the only solution, however its unfortunate that the solution was that I do not have full feature access because of the way Sharepoint integrates with OneDrive.

      "My situation is that I lost thousands of files previously when my personal OneDrive/365 account expired. I already had my business premium in place. I started this support ticket and then another (because I wasn't getting a call at one point). The support guy had me move this huge amount of data from one account to the other although I don't remember the details of that.  In short, the folder structure exists but I've not been able to find any of the files so I came back to you for help. The fellow today was great and tried very hard to help me recover these files, but to no avail.  So when I thought my files were safe (since they were on your server in the cloud), it wasn't really the case.  As you would imagine, it means an incredible amount of extra time in my future to do business, not to mention all of the personal files/photos that were lost.  Not a good day for me. The problem was a bit frustrating and confusing, but the support was great. I now understand the primary issue that I was having. Another thing that I brought up was not resolved, but it could have been something that I did wrong. The one disappointment with this ticket was that the call came in many hours (maybe 12 hours) after I submitted the ticket.  And the real reason for this ticket was due to not being able to get a call back on another ticket.  In other support tickets that I have submitted, the calls/support have been great.  Note that I'm not blaming the fellow that I spoke with today for this as he wasn't involved with the previous ticket and likely wasn't on duty when I submitted this ticket.\n",

      "The tech did try several things to get the emails to open in Edge, the browser I was currently using but it did not resolve the issue.  He was very helpful in exploring other issues and we ended up going back to using Internet Explorer and the emails opened successfully from that browser.  Oli was polite and willing to help me &quot;reset&quot; Edge, but I did not want to do that.  I will use Internet Explorer instead.  And it was only one person&#39;s emails that have this issue so I will contact again, if more emails are effected.&#10;Thank you- Laura Shelly&#10;Best Regards It is a tricky thing to \"rate\"  as there was nothing that a tech  could do to help me.  I accept that, as I knew that what I needed was not most likely not possible for the tech to retrieve. I was not allowed to be on the call, Nitin said that was not necessary.  So I confirm with the employee I will take his word for Nitin reported that he got the employee syncing, I do not see the sharepoint  library.  I had mentioned in my initiating call with the tech, that there were 2 places that needed to be syncing OneDriver AND a library on our SharePoint site.  The Syncing button  is still not working on SharePoint site to get that library syncing the one computer, I need a tech to come back and make sure the SharePoint Library / syncing button works and that library, too.  Thank you for contacting me or my employee, Joann once more.&#10;Laura Maggie was a wonderful help and solved the issue with a great sense of humor on top of it.  She kept me calm while we handled some pretty important permission issues. Thank you Shawn was a great help- he got the issue solved quickly and thoroughly answered my questions! I was hoping to have a calendar set up so that employees could submit a time off request, and managers could approve it. It wasn't obvious how to do it (be it through Outlook or Sharepoint) so I called for help. Nasir was very helpful and great to work with, but unfortunately we hit the limits for what the software can provide. I am hoping that we can have access to a calendar in the future where users can submit requests,*a specific, designated manager* can receive the request, and then approve it. After approval, all employees should be able to see if someone took off on that day or not (not necessarily the reasons why, in fact I'd prefer if we could respect our employees' privacy in this case buy just showing \"free/busy\"). Good job thanks for your help Mason. Diane did a great job and quickly! Noel was very knowledgeable  thanks\n",

He was able to work through the issues in an efficient manner and got my computer back up and running. Prem was able to quickly figure out my issue and get it resolved.  I appreciated the follow up call the next day just to make sure it was working as he planned. My tech did a great job of fixing the issue I was having and showed me some ways to use the system more efficiently and effectively that will greatly help in our day to day work. Samy did an excellent job getting my issue with One Drive resolved. Neth did a great job of configuring my computer to handle my OneDrive personal account since it was conflicting with my work account. Lake did resolve may issue and helped some other things I needed to get installed. Waiting to see if the synching resolves the problem quick response There is an Outlook degradation issue going on that prevented my installing Outlook on my Surface Pro - it would have been nice - and maybe I missed it - to have an announcement made about the degradation going on.  Also, disappointed to learn that when we UPGRADED to the Business Premium E3 - we lost the ability to use the Outlook Customer Manager which we were experimenting with as a CRM Rakesh did a quick and fast solution to my issue.\n",

      "Muy buen soporte he podido solucionar el problema que tenia de no poder ver las graficas de las aplicaciones en SharePoint. La consulta no se pudo solucionar debido a que el requerimiento tenia que ver con dos tenat diferentes; pero se encontró otra alternativa de solución desde la APP de OneDrive. Al parecen aun hay muchos problemas con la plataforma de Skype y de TEAMS, no se pueden encontrar contactos para chatear ni para hacer llamadas. Se resolvió plenamente el caso puesto y además se soluciono un tema adicional por el cual no se permitía recibir los correos de la plataforma. El problema se genera en W7 PRO en ocasiones se cierra la APP de OneDrive y al intentar sincronizar nuevamente la APP se tiene que configurar desde cero (0) y no se puede sincronizar facilmente En solicitudes anteriores me han contactado más rápidamente; este caso se demoraron las pruebas porque dependíamos del usuario final; por el mismo tema del usuario final nos queda pendiente una ultima verificación, cuando hagamos esta prueba y si aún no se resuelve el problema abriremos un nuevo caso haciendo referencia a este. Se pudo solucionar la consulta, y se me explicó como funciona la característica de ARCHIVAR de Exchange en las cuentas de correo\n",

      "Tarun was great and he offered me the solution I needed. This comment does not reflect on him, but on the response time. I opened this case about 9AM on Monday of this week, and I chose the &#39;Call Me&#39; function. In the past, the response was quick, within 10 minutes most of the time. The first response I received in the portal was that it was assigned to an engineer, after two days. Then Tarun emailed me and we scheduled a time for him to call. The service this particular time was not what I am used to receiving from Microsoft. I received a quick response and Pratik explained my options for performing a message trace on the distribution list. I received a prompt call back for my issue and the technician helped me create a mail rule to block and delete any emails sent from outside the organization from our domain. Luna was very helpful and professional. He helped me resolve my issue with SharePoint in a timely manner. John&#39;s troubleshooting help led me to suspect our firewall was blocking access. I was able to modify our firewall settings to allow downloading of files via OneDrive. Case was resolved quickly and professionally. Fantastic support experience.  Amit is patient and knowledgable.  He found my issue and guided me to resolve it quickly.  Thank you! Rahul did a great job helping me fix my issue with two-factor authentication. He explained everything well and had a good grasp of PowerShell. Jim was very helpful and called me back within 5 minutes of me placing the ticket. Fixed my Outlook setup issue.

      "Haroon was helpful, patient, and sympathetic. Yes, he was able to resolve the issue we were experiencing. I will say that the platform itself (SahrePoint and OneDrive) is very cumbersome, and I found it too easy to make changes that caused alarm (duplicate SharePoint sites and folders, for example). Haroon needed to explain them to me and their cause, and most were relatively benign, but at an organizational level for my users, its way too easy to make a change that will cause alarm, ultimately impacting their level of trust in and adoption of the product. Obviously powerful, but not intuitive and/or simple enough to be used readily and effectively. Support personnel was adequate. Product is not. O365 and SharePoint not delivering on par with G-suite which we migrated from. G-suite is simple, effective, and flawless. The frequency with which I need to contact support to resolve issues that I know nothing about is frustrating, and trying my patience with the Microsoft platform. No doubt it is capable, but it is not simple, nor does it work consistently. That's perhaps the best way to describe my experience with O365 and SharePoint thus far - unreliable. This is not what I had hoped for nor expected when making the decision to migrate a few months ago.\n",

Unfortunately however, the inability for me to see externally shared folders/files in one place is a significant issue for my business.  I cannot have dozens or possibly even hundreds of URL links to separate files/folders that are not visible when I log into my office 365 or Sharepoint account.  If every time a person from an external organization shares a file with me, it requires a separate web based window, I cannot use OneDrive for Business or Sharepoint for my company.

The OneNote web clipper would not allow me to clip to my Business Premium account because of the size of my OneDrive data (around 100G -- which is only 10% of the file size limit) so we found a work around to clip to my OneNote personal folders (and then move the info) however... this seems to be a bug that I hope MS resolves in the future. Very helpful and shared several options that help me understand how we can setup emails moving forward. Thank you! My support rep was very helpful and patient and we resolved the pending issues that I&#39;ve had since I began my shift to using O356 several months ago.  The overall setup has been quite a bit more complicated than I expected but the tech support resources I have worked with have been very helpful and I look forward to moving forward to master my use of the O365 tool... instead of spending my time troubleshooting. Was wanting to use Skype for Business to replace Join.me when conducting conference calls with clients, but SfB just doesn't have the ability to quickly connect to the clients that I need. Unfortunately, unless this process is improved, I will not be using SfB. I want to share 2 important outcomes for real-world use cases. 1) the TASK delete button is right next to the Save/Close button. Often (not always) when the delete button is accidentially clicked, the task deletes WITHOUT a prompt asking \"Are you Sure?\" That prompt needs to be added... or at least move the delete button so it's not side-by-side. 2) I'm a heavy task user and I've shifted from using recurring tasks to creating a task and then \"rolling it forward\" to the next date I want to use it. I tried using recurring tasks at first but if it's a monthly task and you don't get it done -- the next month's task doesn't show up. That's a problem, so I now \"ROLL\" the date of a task to the next date when I want it completed. This has worked PERFECTLY for years UNTIL.... I had my email archive turned on AND..... all of my tasks that were created more than 2 years ago \"disappeared/\" We finally found them -- they moved to my archive folder -- and the alert doesn't work! How do we stop that? Our support rep was very helpful and patient.  I felt he went over and beyond and I was very impressed with the level of support provided.  Thank you!\n",

After 7 days of trying to solve this issue there has not been any progress. Yeye has done her best but there comes a time when we all need to admit that we have not come across an issue before and need help. After much persuasion Yeye did ask for help. Another consultant / ambassador called me on Friday and tried several things, again no progress. I then had to &quot;insist&quot; on the correct consultant to contact me. It did seem to me that there was not anyone available to help me.&#10;In the past several ambassadors i found both knowledgeable and able. I would therefore ask if they were available:- Nilesh Parab email:- v-9nipra@microsoft.com OR Anshu S Singh email:- v-9anss@mssupport.microsoft.com -- I think after 2 attempts with No resolution should start a process for additional help. Reinstalled new sync for OneDrive. All resolved and very happy with service. Oliver was very patient with me and very helpful Issue was resolved Bry was very knowledgeable and polite.

I was presented with several viable workarounds and some unrelated useful information. Thanks again for the help! Issue resolved! Eboni&#39;s support and bedside manner is excellent.

Unfortunately, we resorted to blowing out OneDrive sync client and re-syncing the sharepoint document library against the local dataset to resolve the issue.

I am satisfied with the support which Siddhartha (sp?) provided me. He was super courteous and thorough. Unfortunately my issue is with a feature which was never designed.

Domain help did what I needed and we have a go-forward plan.&#10;OneNote remains a problem due to the fact that I cannot create a OneNote file with my local OneNote2016 software and save it to my corporate sharepoint site. The program says I must save locally or to my OneDrive account but neither are set to share (and I don&#39;t want to have them shared). I do see sharepoint as an option to save but it errors out telling me I have to use OneDrive. If this restriction cannot be removed, at least make the error message more descriptive so your users don&#39;t spend hours trying to find a way to save to SharePoint (which is suggested as a valid option when sharepoint shows up as a valid save to option.\n",

      "Milen was superb at resolving my problem, thank you once again 365 support for your excellent service. Mon was excellent with his clear and concise expert knowledge regarding correcting the problems we are experiencing with OneDrive. Highly recommend as giving excellent customer support. Because the Raneela Khan was awesome (I could not give feedback on the day via 365 due my system freezing but I did email her via LinkedIn congratulating her on her awesome support) she quickly solved an issue that our IT service provider had not been able solve for over a year. We have now stacked them because we were not told by then them that we could go to Microsoft direct for support and the support you have given has been nothing but excellent.  In fact they told us that Skype for business was not fit for purpose and that they had contacted you and you were unable to solve the issue. They used this excuses for all errors, which it transpires was with their system and not Microsofts. Bryan was excellent and resolved a number of problems that were outstanding on our system. All resolved, knowledge, attention and service all brilliant. There were issues with the quality of the call and the individual giving the support not listening regarding one the email addresses not actually being a live mailbox, as the member of staff had left 6 months previous to the problem. Persistence paid off in the end, well done James was excellent at dealing with this issue and we closed it quickly Excellent speedy service to resolve the issue of deleting users from a 365 exchange that was attempting to sync with an active directory that hasn&#39;t existed for over 12 months. The issue was a Windows 7 one and the knowledge of the support team was excellent in quickly installing the correct files to fix the fault.\n",

Many Thanks! Eric absolutely crushed my problems yet maintained the demeanor of Bob Ross, the best painter of all time.   Seriously.

No.  Beautify day,\" said the murderous surgeon. Andi has both skills and personality.  He solved my problems and we had fun doing so.  Really.  Great work by both Andi and HR.  Finding good people is the hardest part of running a business. Jason is spectacular.  Not only is he friendly and easy to talk to, but he is diligent and tenacious in his efforts to resolve problems.  Above, when I was asked &quot;...how satisfied are you with Office 365,&quot; I answered that I am &quot;Somewhat satisfied.&quot;  That&#39;s true; the software isn&#39;t seamless.  We&#39;ve been using Office 365 for a while now and we&#39;re only now being told to use SharePoint as our file sharing service, thanks to Jason.  This is something we&#39;ve needed for a long time because OneDrive isn&#39;t as fluid for multiple users.  I would have loved to have known the difference ages ago.  Again, thanks to Jason, we now know.  And, also thanks to Jason, it works. Abby is great!  She was clear and able and worked hard to find a solution to my problem.  She consulted with others within her group and was able to find the best option for me.  I appreciate good help tremendously, as it&#39;s so hard to find.  Thank you for hiring decent people.

      "The support call and service was fine.  My issue is with the Office product itself - once again, keeping me working late into the night trying to get computers running smoothly again.  I don't see any end of this in sight.  I am regretting having chosen to have our small business on Office 365.  The cloud server concept sounds good as a possibility, but is causing a lot of stress in actuality.  There is a lot of stress in knowing whether everybody's computer is syncing with the server or not.  You don't have that issue with an on-premise server.  I also keep having license issues unless there was a full uninstall of any prior versions of Office.  I can't seem to get rid of all the remnants in most cases, and it seems the best thing to do is reformat the hard drives and start new.  With 15 computers, I won't be resting at ease about our IT for some time. We were able to resolve this issue, but it did take a long time to come up with a fix.  I originally submitted ticket #11740704 the night before, and after 2 hours on that call late into the night, I needed to go home and get some sleep.  I then opened this ticket the next morning.  It seems my problem with having all my files locked on certain computers was not something in your knowledge base.  I feel we kept looking for some sort of admin setting that got changed instead of looking for a simple solution, like resetting the Library sync with OneDrive.  Sometimes the best solution is a simple one. Although this was not a specific incident or problem ticket, the Microsoft support agent stayed in constant contact via email to make sure I was getting the help that I needed.  Our small business was having a number of sync, email, and licensing issues that were really causing a hardship.  The most difficult thing however, was when our SharePoint group file system became locked for editing on half of our computers.  I submitted separate tickets for this issue and gave my feedback  on those tickets.  I am hopeful that the worst of the migration issues are over and that we can now focus on our business, with Office 365 at the core of our IT platform. Good support call, we resolved the issue.  Thanks The frustration level is very high at our office of 10 employees who rely daily on email, office apps, and server on a high usage basis.  I don't have an issue with my support calls, I mainly have an issue with Microsoft 365 for Business product which is supposed to be for small business on a small IT budget.  It is turning out to be more trouble than it is worth.  I am spending more time on IT than I ever have to get this thing to work, but there is always another issue, every day Thank you...finally resolved a late night issue, trying to figure this out.  Alex was very knowledgeable and helpful very pleasant support experience, agent led me right to the resolution, and we discussed some other features in the Microsoft subscription that I purchased, namely SharePoint\n",

Great support! Great job. Thank you. Thanks for the great help. Truly appreciated. Excellent Support. Thank you for taking the time to help me through the issues I was having. Excellent service. Thank you for your patience as we resolved the issues. First class support. It became apparent that to archive former employees email and OneDrive data is a rather laborious process. I really wish Microsoft would devise a simpler process for archiving old employee data.\n",

      "I had what ended up being a rather silly issue (recycle bin in the OneDrive online needed to be emptied).  Rep heard that OneDrive for my desktop wasn't syncing and was immediately certain that the desktop app was the problem (it wasn't).  The advice she gave me resulted in me having to re-install OneDrive for desktop and re-download 900 GB of files.  Needless to say I am not happy.  I think if she had actually listened to me instead of following her tech support script my problem could have be resolved very easily.\n",

He listened attentively to my issue although I practically had verbal diarrhoea and just talked AT him but he was patient and understanding. He solved all my issues and helped with some other impromptu queries I had. He is an asset to Microsoft and your support team. Thank you Emmersson! Dean went over and beyond to help me with the billing and more so with the issues I had with OneDrive. He kept checking in on how I was getting on, on nearly a daily basis, and even had his colleague to do the same the one day he was off!! Today, he rang in and we did a screen share and he didn&#39;t end the call until every aspect of my issues and concerns were dealt with very patiently, even if it meant the call lasted nearly 3 hours!! The customer service I received from Dean is by far excelled the image and reputation of Microsoft. I cannot praise him enough, honestly!! He deserves a huge bonus!!\n",

      "very fast response While your agent was very helpful and explained why I am having this issue, I find it hard to a accept that this is being caused by poor network performance at non-corporate sites. I would expect cloud-services like OneDrive and SharePoint to be able to upload files from lower-bandwidth connections. This should simply be by-design. Files sub-100Mb upload fine from low-bandwidth connections, its just larger files. I assume this is an IIS timeout value which should be modifiable. Thanks very much for your help and advice.\n",

We got the immediate problem of not syncing a file fixed but there was no idea how to prevent this in the future or tell when the problem was occurring (the file was not syncing but the blue cloud was clear and the file had a green check mark next to it) solved the problem and sincerely asked if could help with anything else. Agent was pleasant but no real solution to my problem. Lately the help that we are getting for the onedrive sync tool has been awful.

      "Mia provided detailed steps of the process. However I was still experiencing an issue with the process which was due to my lack of knowledge of the system. She guided me through the steps again in a remote session and we were successfully able to setup within the environment and confirmed with multiple users they were restricted. I apricate her time and effort in resolving the issue. This is no reflection on Chris. There was a limitation in Windows 10 to procure licences through the Office 365 portal. Tested on 3 windows 10 machines using 3 browsers (Chrome, IE &amp; Edge) with 3 different Global Admin accounts. Was only able to proceed with the transaction when I logged into a Windows 7 OS machine. Otherwise the process failed on Step 3. This is not reflected at Umair directly. We were very disappointed with the whole service. We have experienced 3 major disruptions to our SharePoint\\OneDrive for Business system over the last 2 weeks and we as the IT team need to provide evidence around the issue and how it mitigate it in the future. Any assistance from Microsoft will be greatly apricated as given it's a SaaS we don't have any control over the availability and infrastructure. We still have no clear evidence why these occurred - we were advised by Umair to reference the Microsoft Service Health Reference Number, SP140739 which we should be able to see in the Heath > Service Heath section of the Admin Console. During our last phone conversation with Umair the article was not not visible, Umair advised it can take \"awhile\" for them to be uploaded. We have just checked again and nothing is still there. We still need to provide clear details of the 3 incidents to our Executive Team and Board. Santos and Charlie provided excellent support and follow up, providing relevant information and answering my questions. Joy assisted greatly with providing relevant information and we cancelled the E3 subscription. Virginia was very helpful and assisted me in resolving the problem even through it was not her speciality. A pleasure to deal with. Quick response. Resolution was achieved after subscription fault was fixed. Still awaiting a response from HaJung with relation to the overdue account. Warren was very helpful and helped me resolve the outstanding issue. He was a pleasure to deal with, an asset to the support team. Thanks Cindy Great assistance and support for our issue.\n",

Very helpful - thank you As you can see from the note on the ticket above, at Hector&#39;s suggestion I made an appointment to be available from 9.30am -11am in the office.  This took quite a bit of organising my side as I was going away - not your issue of course but just to confirm users have lives too.  No one called until 13.10 by which time I was on a train.  This is so unhelpful.  In the meantime I opened a fourth ticket to get it fixed. First big thanks to Stephen for solving this case in a really gracious way.  He read the tickets, acknowledged my frustration and handled it in a way which took account of the challenges this end.  I&#39;ve given it a poor rating so the ticket is reviewed - your support processes don&#39;t meet the ITIL sector best practices I was taught which is disappointing.

I would like to be able to change my custom SP template to a default template and have been told it's not possible. Liam was very helpful and kept in touch as we worked on this issue. I asked to close this ticket due to lack of time. Very polite and helpful technician. He solved my problem. Very helpful and knowledgeable. Did not take long to fix. Very helpful Luke was very helpful and efficient. Answered my questions promptly. This issue resolved itself before the call. Tech was very helpful and polite and resolved the issue for me. We found out that it was a computer issue at the remote location. The tech was very nice, but the answer is not satisfactory. Microsoft changed something between Friday and Monday that affected the way I was using OneDrive because I made no changes over the weekend. This happens all too often and makes me and my users unhappy, frustrated and unproductive. The answer was merely that it's not allowed per an article when I shared a folder with the same external user 8 days before. Very pleasant and knowledgeable tech. Worked to a resolution. My question was answered very politely and efficiently. I learned everything I needed to know. This was solved rather quickly. Good job. I hope the fix lasts! Tech support was very nice and helpful. Answered the question I need to have answered. Good service. I'm not thrilled about Outlook Groups and SharePoint being tied so close together. It doesn't make sense and can lead to errors involving loss of data. Whoever thought of that? I am still having some issues with your software, but we have found a workaround which solves the main issue. Very helpful. Could not have figured it out by myself.\n",

I am really dissapointed though to find out that I can not share my files with external users unless they have a valid MicroS Acc. as this was one of our main reasons for choosing OneDrive as secure platform for storage and sharing. I dont want my external clients to go through complicated steps to be able to see the files I&#39;ve shared. Additionally - security for our external clients might not allow them to set up their work account for microsoft, as they are working within regional and communal municipalities and have very strict security. Im also dissapointed to learn that i can not set up an email for my staff if I registrate them as users just because they dont have a license. To me it seems like a moneymaking machine! (Excuse the forwardness.)  &#10;We will go on looking for a better option with secure sharing for our external clients.&#10;Best regards Fine forslag til forbedringer og venter resultater af det vi skal prøve.

The support people I talked to were very helpful, but they did not resolve the issue.  There seemed to be a certain lack of familiarity with the Customer Manager app, which is, of course a new release.\\nThe issue did resolve itself, which may have had something to do with updating the server.  \\nI got help from both Ireland and Singapore.  Both were very helpful.  The man from Singapore was extremely knowledgeable. Ram solved my issues quickly and effectively.  Give him a raise. Tracy was fantastic and answered questions about Outlook that have been bothering me for years.  She both solved the problem I came with and 3 or 4 other problems.

I really need this to be more seamless. Really, I ended up solving this issue myself. While the Microsoft person with whom I interacted was most pleasant, he was not able to do anything to help. We still do not know why my client got the error message or what it meant. Basically, I just deleted the entire folder and created a new folder with new invitations. I am concerned this issue could arise again. Conor was very helpful. Even though it took some time and lots of trial and error to determine the issue. However, I did lose an entire folder of client data because of this issue. I was not notified there was a new version of OneDrive, so I never knew to download it. Consequently, my files and folders were not syncing between my computer and SharePoint. I am extremely disappointed in this customer service FAIL by Microsoft. Why in the world would you not let customers who rely on SharePoint as their electronic filing cabinet know that a new download was needed to keep everything running smoothly. My business depends on the accuracy of the sync process. Thankfully, the folder that was lost is an older case and I had not yet shredded all my paper files. I was able to manually scan and recover much of the missing information, but not all of it. Please do a better job of rolling out future upgrades so things like this don&#39;t happen again.\n",

      "Minh An was very polite and helpful but this ticket could have been avoided if a help article existed just showing me where this setting was. It was essentially hidden, and all help articles were about SharePoint not OneDrive, so the sequence of clicks in those articles did not help me find the OneDrive setting. The support person was very helpful, but considering how easy the fix was for this issue, it was a little frustrating that it took 3 emails over a week and a half and finally 45 minutes on the phone to fix it. We resolved my issue but I suspect there is something larger going on for an email to go to the incorrect email address. That's not for support technicians to address, but I often wonder if there's any department reviewing these kinds of issues to correct them in programming. The same goes for the confusing UI on the support assistant. Each time I submit a ticket, I first search for Microsoft help articles to see if I can resolve it myself. Frequently, the articles reference click paths that don't exist within the various admin centers. As the centers are updated, it would be nice if the help articles were updated as well to match.\n",

Thanks for the information. Excellent while i have a manual solution, it is not ideal. Forcing all of my users ( most of which are not tech savvy) to have to unsync and then resync is just confusing and lowers confidence in the sharepoint/ onedrive for business client. Lots of time was spent without a solution. Must wipe the mac anyways. Service was great. Got everything done. However, I&#39;m not sure if more settings were changed than needed to be. All my external sharing settings were set to default as well. I hope this is not going to be common protocol everytime i need to provision onedrive for a new user.

The tool provided was able to fix my issue.

The support person was GREAT!!  However, he is unable to completely satisfy my problem.  I wish that those that have made the decision to do away with Skype for Business would answer the phones and get the direct feed back from Microsoft customers.  Microsoft has treated us badly by taking away Skype.  If Teams had worked as well as Skype that would be one thing, but it DOES NOT!!!  If I had known Microsoft was going to be doing this, I would not have recommended us getting involved with the Office 365.  Microsoft has not listened to the complaints of its customers!  Shame on you Microsoft!!! It was difficult at times to understand the technician, language. Sneha knew exactly what needed to be done to correct the problem.  Very impressive!!! I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated working with Dhanraj on the problem I was having.  He is a very knowledgeable individual.  I did have a bit of difficulty with the language barrier, but overall, Dhanraj did very well.  No doubt, he is quite a professional!! Rafi was very diligent in finding a resolution to the situation. Santosh was very friendly and cordial.  Even though when we connected for a desktop viewing session, I was able to do, what I could not do when I was having the problem earlier.  Microsoft has great support for Office 365 and I immensely appreciate it and their engineers. Ginger was very gracious in the help she gave me.  She answered all my questions and is sympathetic with out situation, even though Microsoft is NOT!!! The Engineer reminded to try something I should have tried before calling.  Run a repair.  That did the trick.  Thanks!!! The technician knew the situation was a known problem and he found the information for me to repair it. April was GREAT to work with.  She found out the problem immediately and showed me what went wrong.  She is very knowledgeable!!! The Engineer was delightful to work with.  This is a real problem from what I have seen by posts on the internet, but he tried different methods, he came across a simple fix for me.  I am so appreciative of his assistance.  Thank You!!! Dhey was very good at explaining what was happening and what we needed to do to solve the problem. Xiejay is a miracle worker!!

Great help, Great resources they have to draw from. Tina was very helpful giving me a URL of an article I can research.  She is setting up a callback tomorrow morning. Julian was very helpful.  He was willing to research the situation, even though he had not come across it before.   I do not slight a person for that!  I would much rather have an engineer tell me he has to research, rather than guess.  Thank you for your help Julian!!! Gaurav was great to work with!!!

He called back just as he promised and let me know what was happening and why I could not view my user's OneDrive.  Thanks so much, Carlo!!!! The problem was solved by the technician. Tracey was a great help.  He helped me find the location to change the view of OneDrive and everything worked!!!  Thanks a BUNCH!!! Thank you so much for your help with this situation, I learned a great deal from you and I will put it into practice in the future.  Microsoft is fortunate to have someone like you, so knowledgeable and so patient working with me for the past days.  You are a credit to Microsoft!!!  It has been a great experience working Eddie.  With experiences like this, I am more and more confident we made the correct decision in going with Microsoft as our online Office, Exchange, and Sharepoint provider. I enjoyed visiting with the Engineer.  He was very knowledgeable about the situation I was trying to accomplish, once I explained to him in depth the situation.

      "Kaz really helped me with an explaination of the 365 features in a way that I could put into practice. working with Joe was a real delight. Nizar did me the courtesy of doing something with saving things (in different ways) in the onedrive. Apparently, there are places in the File Explorer that show the exact place a file is going to be stored in.  I need to be careful to store things or save things to the exact place.  So, for example when I am saving a template in excel, or word, I see my business onedrive and double click on it, I see custom templates, I save to Excel or word templates and browse if I can't find it, and then I can carry the same formatting to another and another place.  If I can improve at 67 years old, I am on the Praying Mantis thing where they only get 3 months to live.  At the end of the summer the males just try to go down smiling.  Those are the Yes, praying mantis question --Just jump off and try to die happy.  But wait, the Planning Question answer No, is that someone my jump off and hit something on the way down and not, die laughing or smiling...  So, there was a presumption was good but no Turiya....helped me so much with understanding Microsoft products. So, my conclusion after talking to her is a strategy of simply calling Microsoft when anything with microsoft is hard to understand.  Judge Judy says: \"If it doesn't make sense, it's not true.\"  With persistance with something I didn't understand, didn't make sense, she was able to find the untrue thing and fix it.  Here is what goes with that concept: \"What part of no do you not understand implies that there is no part of a persons no because their no is no.  Right?  So, you have two bible principals: Let your yes be yes and your no be no.  This way it avoids inconsistancy and confusion.  Perhaps irritation in the voice of the person who says: What part of NO!  So, if you are a salesman with antisolicitation laws in place, an experienced mature person would say: Okay, (doing body language to show backing off and away) Excuse me! Please, have a nice day.  Then, the experianced person, being like Arsenio Hall would go HM the experience was great. Jay fixed the problem in a nice way. Bhex taught me how to set the custom paper size for a tripod presentation to be printed in word.  I need to use word to paste a pdf to the paper size I am using.  Then, being careful to make the pasted picture to scale, and fit inside the paper size margins without distorting, I can then use the snipit tool to copy the word document page by page into the side presentation.  Thank You, it was a good and productive meeting to accomplish my qoal of having both the word document to print at the printer for the proffectional reproduction and to not be embarased at my first slide show presentation with the planing and zoning town hall meeting. It's amazing how confused I could get with all the software products and the claims they make about how they are are only ones to develop something to go with the Microsoft Word, Excel or Powerpoint.  Then, after doing some investigation with my friends there at Microsoft, it's only a twain driver or something that is 15 years old. It's not new.  In fact, it's standardized technology that is not particular to what ever company is trying to push it.  I really like it the way that my Microsoft 365 explains how I don't need this or that for my business. Anthony was terrific at explaining my 365 that I am an admin, a business 365 enterprise owner with a user name and password.  I can get my documents to go back and forth between my printer and my business OneDrive as long as I use cloud services. Darrel did a whole lot of cli king so that we clicked and got on track with the way to accomplish what I need to do.  So now that I am routed to the channel I want I will stay on it by myself until I call microsoft again to get new intructions. I thank the microsoft team for their help with my understanding the product.  If I were to use DEX with my Samsung phones with 7 people sitting at their desks with a samsung Note Nine in a seminar, the 7 people would be able to edit doccument on monitor with limited capabilities of the Microsoft Office for Android.  The clients may type in words to cells, change fonts but they would not be able to change the master document by changing formats or anything.  When the seminar is over, I can collect the phones and erase what has been written and give phones out to the second class seminar.  Since no significant changes to the master document has occured, I can lead the second class with the master document. I think this is true but I will have to try it. Cyril did a very nice job at changing the appearance of my business enterprise account so that it was easier to access and removed the personal one drive from the default.  I now have everything with my business visually correct. I can count on Microsoft. I can trust them. Jason, Gia is very nice and polite to help me understand simple features of the excel instead of reinventing the wheel.  after some exploration by a very determined Gia, a diferent solution can be found.  I have pleanty of time to work with what he provided. This Len is working so hard to help me with issues.  No one likes to have issues and if people pretend they don't, they are in denial.  So thank you so much for giving me Len who helped me with a microsoft product with much efficiency and humor. great Ferdous I have been using Microsoft Word for many years (maybe 40) and I have always been impressed by the way autosave has improved my experience so that I can not lose my work no matter what I do.  Last night, when I was working in Outlook, I was surprised by the way, the document was like a \"loose canon\".  I am working on a sensitive touch screan with a sensitive touch pad that I can acidentally hit either the screen or the mouse in the wrong place and all the editing I did would be lost.  This made me think that auto save was not working in Outlook.  So, I went into the trusty Word document to prevent losing the editing with the trusty autosave feature. My distrust for the Outlook became very high.  However,   Ferdous was very intuitive and noticed a little red x on the right side of the Outlook email that said \"DISCARD\".  This X is right near where I scroll up or down the document.  It is likely that inadvertently I hit it. Ferdous fixed it so it wouldn't happen again. Eric was personalble knowledgable about how to make the product easier to use, and he was unique in that he wasn't rushed or nervous no matter which way the session went. Ever since I installed Enterprise, i made all kinds of mistakes. now my files don't open and my outlook is not working.  I don't know how to sign n. Ravindar helped me in an efficient way to find my ancient emails.  I really like the way my Enterprise business 365 is getting organized so that I can keep my business separate from my personal. My experience with 365 was wonderful because it surprised me with how many features there is.  When Jo Ann helped me, she was introducing me to an array of features that I didn't know existed.  As I am a creative person, I can take advantage of an excel spread sheet to do organized writing without getting lost in paragraphs where the order of sentences can't be rearanged without editing the whole paragraph.  As far as how Jo Ann helped me, she turned to one thing after another, until all the subjects were covered to my delight. Sagar was very congenial. When looking at the Microsoft model of ethical behavior such as telling me what products would be suitable for my Enterprise E3 business use, he told me the truth and nothing but the truth.  He showed me with skill how to optimise the use of the product and the new products that can be accessed.  I felt as though I was self determining my destiny with the gentle hand of Sagar.  Options that could be costly or illegal were discussed and abandoned.  The strategies we discussed were apprapo with what is going on in the business and personal world of dog eat dog or snake eat snake! Doris Dai helped me very much understand the microsoft products.  I needed a website for my business.  I have a domain in Sharepoint.  It is private not public.  Only those I invite will be able to collaborate.  I was helped to develope a way to communicate with an excel program to separate ideas for a website that I will develop with a third party host.  I can even go as far as to develop an application for my business so that the public can choose to pick from two choices either yes or no to a question that normaly you would see threatening body language.  This is beautiful because words in microsoft writing and websites strip off all the drama.  Hidden body language yeilds intellectually honest results.  It's great.  Thank you very much Doris! Tanuj helped me to bring the strategy of collaboration to two problems.  The first problem solved: 1.) To make the world a better place though developing an idea that would promote peace rather than canabablizm.  Dog eat Dog, Snake eat Snake.  Snail eat Snail.  If the Jailed Snail (Me) tries to break the conventions and help other snails step out of what they do everynight to get food, (namely get the advantage over eachother) and he can have an alternative way ... the problem is always going to be that there are those snails which profit by the carnage and don't want it to stop.  Tanuj is one of those individuals who will gently prod the customer (to stear clear) (to climb to the top to get a better view) (to not use all resourses but to withhold the best for last leg of the race) and this knowlege about how to stay alive in the dangerous night is very valuable.  If I could do both 1.) invent and 2.) entertain to avoid geting a total \"root canal\" of my being. Thank you. Netesh  once again fixed a problem I didn't know I had. If the files in OneDrive are not synched by the date modified, I would not be able to find the work I did conveniently.  Now that that is fixed, if there is another panic where I do not have a way to take a document from someone and use a printer somewhere, I will view the window on the printer menu and save that document hopefully in the cloud one drive on my computer.  Then, it being in mycloud, I can access it from any of my documents using my 365 subscriptions.  Good work.  Please, if I see something in my 365 that is not relient on outside printers or third party software, let me \"insert from scanner option\" from my computer-laptop Maybe---through the share button.  To develop this in Microsoft (if it is not there already) would be helpful.  Thank you for everything Nitesh, you are very progressive and generous. Mhond worked quickly and with purpose which makes him unique in the tech world. If he said: \"Let us try something\", he had a good reason to try it and didn't waste time with anything that wasn't going to purely work.  If he did try something that didn't pan out, he'd admit and say \"My Bad\" which \"By the way\" is an expression My Bad is added to the dictionary. which makes him a MEEK one and will really get him to \"assured expectation\" of the thing hoped for. Errol was able to show me around Enterprise.  I have Quick Access to any document, any download any pdf, jpg from the search bars.  The problem was that I was sharing my device with my Husband's 365 Home at the time that I installed my Enterprise which caused me to have 3 one drives with documents trying to open that were named identically and onedrive didn't understand what doc was what doc.  the applications were freezing and the files were getting the red x's and corrupted with the squigley.  AutoRecover couldn't keep up and Recovery D was full. This got sorted out by sending all the files on the personal one drive to my Bally.biz one drive so that they are separated into a couple folders within my new One Drive.  Uploading took 3 days with me finally not touching my device and leaving it on overnight to sort out the problem.  I now have my picture on the upper right side jo ann and Jason and Havier worked on my one drive and set it up perfectly but the minute they were done, I opened all the browsers, never closed any of my windows and trudged into the snow until I was knee deep in applications and had so many synching situations with Google chrome that I was unable to open word or excel or the internet because I had two of them! Two of each, like the five fingered blues player.  Supposed to be good to have five fingers but you only need five on each hand and the other extra just hangs out.  It's a mediphore. thanks all Renvir was really really knowledgeable about how to fix the conflict that resulted from me sharing my husbands account which was a Microsoft 365 Home.  I managed to have a Microsoft 365 Personal account that had many many files but as small One Drive.  Renvir was able to take all the millions of files from my personal 365 to my Enterprise account OneDrive.  Now, I only lost one word document which I had worked on for 8 hours on the 13th of August.  I am thinking positively though and can recreate the word doc and it will be better than the first.  Even though I worked on it a long time, I now can make it with drawings in color and get it done much faster.  I am very happy with my new Enterprise account because I am also writing a book, an interactive book and will be using skype and Microsoft Flow to do that.  I am also planing to use the data I will collect for Yes or No answers for everyone.  Interesting. Hey? First Zeah installed Bing instead of Chrome because I thought I was having problems with chrome and sign in with my personal email and sign in with my Business email and also problems with having a Gmail email. Since I had too many google accounts, I was thinking that (I was wrong; I think, but I was thinking it anyway) that:  Chrome was interfering with the way my computer opened after booting up.  So, just to calm me down, Zeah made Edge my default browser.  I didn't like the appearancde of the Edge- never did like to be confronted with the news every time I open my computer.  Instead, I want to see just what my business interests are.  So, Zeah helped me blank out all that weather news and things, and let me add some bookmarks imported from Google, and my passwords so that I will see familiar interests of mine.  She thought, and I don't know if she was wrong-that my Windows 10 was opening up under my personal email, which is the same as my email I use for my 365 Personal account. Right in the middle of an attempt to get help from Microsoft about my Enterprise Account IMI, Inventions or Entertaiment, I could not place or recieve a phone call because my cell phone account had been disconnected for non payment.  I paid the bill from some work I was doing and got the service back on.  I called 365 to reestablish this issue about all the files being a mess, and the support representative Kali, thought I was just gaoing to have to bring my computer to Bust buy and figure out why the files were all frozen and that I could solve the problem in most cases by turning my comperter on and on or ooff and on.  Yeah.  I had all these files in auto recover but was unable to open the files that were saved in the recovery.  There was even a red lettered warning saying that one of my files was erased..  I could use a third party partner to help me figure out how to methodically save my files in pc, one drive, template folders.  Then comes the Cameron fix! I am so grateful!\n",

The issue keeps coming back in every 10-15 days, and then I have to wait for a week or two before the problem is being fixed.  The problem will then come back again after two weeks ... I cannot continue to use OneDrive with confidence, how can I deal with it? Microsoft Support did advise me to further troubleshoot my local network and I appreciate the advice and assistance. Call back is quick and very responsive. The so-called support did not provide assistance or troubleshooting professionally, and eventually I fixed the problem by myself.

Really not applicable as I was having telecommunications issues that prevented a discussion with the rep. But I don&#39;t have the option to choose &quot;Not Applicable&quot;. Dedicated and friendly service with thorough follow-up. Problem resolved efficiently. Thank You! As always (of late), the help was great. Too early to know if the problem is fixed - waiting for the synchronized library to be repaired. Perhaps in the future MS staff can create a function that allows the sync client to recognize when it has stalled and then automatically launch a repair session? Problem efficiently resolved. Four stars only because there is a known issue with SharePoint (and Skype). These complicate our operations and there is no known ETA for bringing everything back to normal. The representative did the best he could given the cards he was dealt. Problem addressed and resolved quickly. Nothing had to be done - the problem disappeared as mysteriously as it appeared. The assistant was courteous and understood our issue. I will again make my plea for change. Please, please do away with forcing use of autosave in Office 365. Please allow admins to turn this feature off if they choose to do so. Forcing it&#39;s application creates a nightmare for maintaining a clean document audit trail. I have neither the time nor the desire to retroactively lock down all finalized documents. My people know how to save documents. Your feature is fine for those too dumb to understand how to save a document; but after 3+ decades of using Office documents without this feature, I think most users have learned the hard way to regularly save important documents.\n",

It had 3 suggestions, and the first one that I tried worked. Paul was great, got me through an install that needed to be done fast. Mark quickly directed me to the right people. Sarah did a great job and hung in there until everything was complete and we had the Inbox running exactly as it needed to.  She REALLY hung in there, and was super-courteous.  Your tech people are pretty neat, and Sarah was just EXEMPLARY! Got some good help; it&#39;s just MS up to its old tricks again. All set. Got a real solution. And even found out some info that i did not have. And got my retention policy updated to a better state. Super help, smart, and fast! Really quick call, great answers, and a good resolution. Thanks! Malik really got in there and nailed this problem. You guys are amazing! Monise was great, and was able to explain why the behavior of the program had changed, and how the PC may have tried to draw from the Credential Manager because I had not yet signed in to my LastPass credential Manager. We never did find out why my customer's email, when sent from one certain person, and in that case only, showed as me. Patrick did help me change my Office license over to my current subscription, so Outlook, Word, and so on no longer display as \"unlicensed\". So, even though the case of one email address when sent from one specific person [incorrectly] displays my name, at least we got my Office licenses updated. Patrick was also very courteous and persistent. One negative was that, on about half of the calls, the phone connection from Microsoft was very poor and Patrick had to redial my number to get a connection clear enough for us to communicate. Thank you, very helpful, even though this was not an Office issue. Monalisa really got me connected fast. I really got a complete and useful answer to my questions. Many thanks! Really friendly and informative about question I really wanted answered! Lisa was super helpful, and I was super confused about the Authenticator. And fast! Jaime was great, and, when MS has the software problem fixed, we will finally resolve this. We got there, though it took a while. It was a mess, but Dennis hung in there until we had a fix. I wish there was a way to save and forward my settings for my MS apps, because now I have to restore all preferences and menu bars. Otherwise, at least we got it done. The only bad news is that we could not find an explanation for why those sections  had gone gray on both the app end and the cloud end.  The good news was that Lamin stayed with me while we tried the OneNote for Business test synchronization &#8212; which did not work, and also that Lamin showed me a way the backup my most important OneNote books to my local drive.  So, all-in-all, a bit scary, but Lamin was there to get me to a solution that would work. The issue was not ever made to work, but I did find out that the feature I was trying to get was simply not available.\n",

The issue has been resolved Daniel got everything straightened out with the Office subscription issue I was having Excellent session.  Looks like we got the issue identified and resolved The impact of the change over from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams is not well understood.  The \"hard switchover\" approach being pushed is flawed because connections to external tenant accounts (such as customer and client accounts) cannot reasonably be coordinated.  It is imperative that both Skype for Business and Teams be set up to run simultaneously.\n",

The only way to resolve this issue was to upgrade my license temporarily to get more space in OneDrive.  That's a big flaw with OneDrive.  Microsoft should be fixing that.

      "No podemos comprender cómo Outlook Escritorio puede limitar a un cliente a enviar correos con ficheros adjuntos de más de 20 Mb, cuando tenemos una máquina potente (estaciones gráficas), y un hosting privado de gran capacidad. Todas las alternativas que nos dan de comprimir o subir a través del OneDrive ya las realizamos hace tiempo. Hoy en día, dado el Hackeo que recibimos constantemente, muchos clientes son reticentes a recibir correos con ficheros comprimidos o de enlaces de plataformas en la nube, por lo que no son buenas soluciones con fiabilidad de confianza. Ya le comentamos al técnico, que si recibimos un correo de más de 20 Mb, en ese caso el servidor del Outlook si nos permite reenviarlo a otro usuario; visto esto, no es lógico que nos limite el envío de correos propios. Entenderíamos que el servidor de Outlook limitase el uso de correos, si fuera el caso de estar trabajando con Outlook Online, pero no es el caso.

I learned a lot from you about how to trace mail and find errors, including failed deliveries. Best regards, Marcin Zmudzki Thank you very much. You are knowledgeable and helpful. You solved my problem and gave me some advice about a related topic on top of it. Your associate first told me that what I asked for was impossible. When I insisted that it must be responsible, only then he researched the issue and agreed that it was possible. He sent me links to interesting tutorials, but the tutorials did not contain ready-to-use step-by-step instructions for migrating files from a network drive to OneDrive in such as way as to leave the files&#39; metadata unchanged. Obviously such functionality should be a available as a standard tool for people to use in data migrations. Thank you very much. You are very knowledgeable and flexible.

I had lots of detailed questions and Kristof understood even my subtle points and answered all of my questions enthusiastically; whether they were very easy or very hard. I now feel confident we can go forward with the upgrade and roll-out of Microsoft 365 and OneDrive for our entire church--thank you!  Kendall was very helpful in working through the various scenarios of OneDrive folder syncing with me so I could better understand the behaviors and use that to set up our user environment. There were a few moments of confusion when Kendall didn't fully understand the behavior of the Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folder when they were in \"backup mode\" but she quickly got that sorted out and now I feel good about moving forward with my new knowledge--thanks Kendall! The agent was very personable, professional, and extremely helpful throughout our entire conversation. I had many questions and all were enthusiastically answered so I felt very confident that we could move forward to the next step of our evaluation of Microsoft 365 for our church--thank you! Gino was very professional and enjoyable to work with!  I had a lot of very specific questions and Gino ensured that each and every one of my questions were answered to my satisfaction. He also showed me Steps Recorder which was really, really, helpful--thank you Gino!!! The agent was quickly and professionally able to narrow down my problem and resolve it in just a few minutes--very efficient!  It was a joy speaking and working with her--thank you! My rep (sorry, I forgot her name) was very helpful. She was able to quickly understand my issue and able to communicate the solution to me in a very easy to understand manner. She was very kind to stay with me on the phone and set up another support session to help me confirm that the solution she gave me would also work for another computer I've been working on even though the problem presented itself differently. I am now confident I can replicate her solution on all 12 of our church's computers.  Thank you! The callback time greatly exceeded my expectations and the rep was very helpful and solved my issue quickly, professionally, and joyfully--Thank You! Arsalaan was very helpful in helping me better understand what my final goal was rather than the specific question I was asking in my ticket and now that I understand Arsalaan's suggestion I'm excited that my migration may be easier than I first anticipated so I'm looking forward to talking with the Azure/Intune team where Arsalaan opened a ticket for me--Thank you! I thought I had a simple question that I almost knew the answer to and just wanted to confirm but I'm so thankful that I reached Bern has he fortunately took the time to thoroughly understand the meaning behind my question and gave me a much better solution than I originally thought was possible. Thank you Bern!! Rez was great. He proactively called me within a few minutes of my reopening the ticket and eagerly and enthusiastically answered all my many questions, each time ensuring I understood everything to my satisfaction.  After Rez's help I can now happily end a 4-day marathon session researching, preparing, as well as accomplishing many of the migration steps which far exceeds my expectations for these 4-days.  BIG THANK YOU Microsoft!  Pooja was extremely helpful to me both in our calls yesterday and last night as well as this morning. I was at a critical point yesterday with our church conversion to Azure AD and at risk of not having the computers available to our staff this (Monday) morning. Fortunately, Pooja was able to sort out the reason for the cryptic error message and showed me a best practice from keeping that from happening in the future. This allowed me to get all 12 computers ready for Monday morning and then Pooja was kind enough to call me back this morning to confirm I got everything running and she showed me helpful suggestions and tools to use within the Intune portal. Thank you Pooja!\n",

      "A very helpful and patient worker at Microsoft support :) The service person on the phone was very helpful and pleasant to talk to, but unfortunately OneDrive for Business does not have the feature I was looking for. It would be great if you could add a feature that resembles the one DropBox have, where you get a Notification when People adds New files into Your folders or if they make changes to the folders. The current Notification centre for OneDrive for business is not as good as the one in Dropbox.\n",

      "Excellent English OneDrive continues for fail for us. While each support agent does all they can do to resolve the issue, the fact remain, OneDrive is a disaster for us.  You should not be advertising it as a solution.  Others will believe you, and then like us, loose data. Enabling Project is way too hard! too confusing between sharepoint sites and groups.... and external sharing. All the support agents are great.  it's just Office products are missing features we need or are very unreliable. In this case, support was great, but they cannot fix missing features...  so, not satisfactory. support is great. your products are not.  OneDrive is awful. Yes, he did all he could do. good job\n",

Get a day off to this guy. xD Great Job Ivan! i don't know why this was closed by business but was resolved in #15426821 Thank you for the help! I was informed by Sailee that the OneNote notebook does not have to be saved in OneDrive for the OneNote client to sync the notebook online. I informed her that instructions from the articles provided by Microsoft says otherwise and that I know for a fact that it has to be. I was informed by another representative who followed up that it does indeed have to be saved in OneDrive as indicated on the instructions provided. I like Manish! He has LUCK with him! He just called me and without doing anything, issue resolves! :D Good to know too that Outlook diagnostic works! Easy call for Manish ;) Sheetal did a great job handling the case, her communication skills were outstanding, she did a wonderful job overall and my issue has been solved.\n",

      "Issue with the error message and dual OneDrive accounts is resolved. Thank you. But it seemed to take an inordinate amt of time for both of us. I'm grateful for the help but feel the SharePoint interface is too primitive and inadequate testing was done before launch so that we both have to waste time on what should be simple setting changes (prohibiting users from syncing Document Library files so that we don't  risk deleting important files or folders when a user deletes the file/folder from his computer and thereby inadvertently deletes it from the SharePoint document library). Syncing should be off by default or the Sync function should be modified so that this is not a risk. We still have some very basic questions about SharePoint Online and now plan to hire a consultant because Microsoft seems to be pulling the plug on our support. Meeraj was extremely patient and helpful with my dozens of questions. Our phone connection was not clear and I had minor trouble with the accent, but those are my problems not his. Thank you Meeraj! We never figured out why we lost access or why it was suddenly resolved, but a long as we can get in, that's good. Alexander was helpful but his accent made it hard for me to understand (and probably vice/versa). I felt that he was not a particularly good listener. I was trying to decide if we needed to change our sites from MS Groups to SharePoint, before we started adding more content. He thought SP was probably better for us, but I would have liked more assurance that the ROI would be worth it. MS needs more documentation around how to decide which sort of sites you want to start with. We were really flailing at first! Michael was wonderful to work with. He was patient, clear, and able to go right to the heart of the problems that I was having. I wish we could request his assistance with my future problems! Thank you for restoring my faith in SharePoint and Microsoft Support. Tim listened well and focused on the problem that I wanted to solve. Thank you! Ron was extraordinarily patient and persistent with software that has much to be desired. He gets a 5, software gets a 3. Yuri was awesome. Patient, clear, and efficient! Thank you! Arantxa was helpful confirming that there is no easy way to edit the domain name. Disappointing but that's not to be helped. Thank you.\n",

AMAZING....I had a very odd issue.  The technician was SO patient, trying to explain why external users could not sync a sharepoint site to onedrive.  He was indeed right.  HOWEVER, I know that this can be done because we did it with OneDrive for Business.  The problem was when you click sync on the SharePoint site, it opens the wrong client.  I knew there had to be a way, without creating a new account and losing the benefits from using their own corporate username and password.  This technician, suggested we create an additional (2nd) account, with no licenses.  We then had to give that account permissions in the SharePoint side (because teams wasn't enough).  After 45 mins of playing around, we have an effective solution.  Fabulous!  Just need to refine the process.  THANK YOU SUPER TECH!!! Very professional, it was a very difficult thing to troubleshoot.  There is a problem with multiple tenants in Teams.  I could only access my team in an Incognito mode in Google Chrome.

I am discouraged that I will have to take 2-3 hours away from my business to address an update issue to an Office 365 application, which should be automatically updated. Alex was efficient, accurate, and to the point. He solved my issue and sent me a URL to give my feedback to Microsoft about my issue. Cey was outstanding! This turned out to be a very complex issue and she resolved it with precision. I am very pleased. Aaron&#39;s technical support was superb!&#10;1. He listened carefully and empathetically and clearly understood my issue.&#10;2. He avoided wasting my time with experimentation and volunteered to test different possible actions on his own system before trying them on me.&#10;3. He resolved the issue in the first meeting and took the initiative to send me additional, helpful information in a follow-up email. I am happy to close this case. However, if issue is not resolved I will be calling again. OneNote continues to be somewhat unstable in syncing. I have to work with a technician one or two times a month to correct syncing errors. There continues to be confusion regarding OneDrive and OneDrive for Business. When I install Office 365 the most current version of OneDrive for Business should install and appear in my Windows Explorer, with the folders and files syncing. This has never happened when I have had to install or re-install Office 365. I have always run into problems getting the correct version of OneDrive for Business installed. Excellent, professional service. Gave value added help. The issue was resolved efficiently. I initiated a request because I cannot load Focus Inbox. There is no tab giving me this option. After spending two hours over a couple of sessions my support technician could not resolve the issue. Two other issues came up and I ended up resolving these other issues myself. I still cannot load Focus Inbox and have no idea what to do next. The technician was very helpful and efficient. Very efficient and knowledgeable. Also accommodated a second question and quickly answered it, as well. I'm very pleased with Pierre's support today. Priyanka was very helpful, persistent, and patient. Although the issue is still unresolved, Priyanka has worked hard and remained very responsive. I appreciate her efforts and continue to have confidence in the support I receive from Microsoft. The tech did not resolve my issue with OneNote syncing and did not get back to me. Luckily I was able to resolve the issue myself. The installation of Project is currently underway. If everything goes smoothly then I will remain very satisfied. The cause of the problem turned out to be the MS 365 version of OneNote that I downloaded from my portal does not have all the features of the standalone version. We had to download the standalone version to solve the problem. I am very frustrated that my MS 365 software is not full-featured software. Microsoft did not inform me of this when I purchased my Enterprise account. Excellent support and follow up. Issue was resolved directly and efficiently. I had to temporarily leave the session. The technician provided an email contact which I used. She called me within a few minutes. Her responsiveness is greatly appreciated. There remains significant confusion between the free Office account and my business enterprise account. Nevertheless, working with my technician I believe we have my software and documents syncing. It will take some time for me to determine if everything is syncing properly. You should survey me again after one day..\n",

      "It wasn't resolved at all, I pressured to close the ticket, the person I was emailing didn't understand my problem. The process to fix my issue took several hours, and it wasn't completely fixed. The tech didn't seem like he fully knew the ins and outs of the functionality of OneDrive and wasn't able to re create the issues i was having, so he couldn't fix them. While trying to resolve this, he called a very unprofessional number of times in order to pressure me to close the ticket. I presume your techs get dinged for having open tickets for longer than a certain amount of time, but the lack of ease of operating the software that I'm paying for shouldn't turn into my having to feel pressured to close a ticket that isn't resolved.\n",

Fortunately, Rob was able to help me make my computer functional again. He was very patient and kind and helped me feel better when I was feeling so low. Eric was very patient and helpful.

That is no way a reflection on the support that was provided during this call though. OneDrive for Business documentation needs some updates to address using multiple accounts in a single client instead of using OneDrive and OneDrive for Business on the same computer to access both personal and work OneDrive storage locations. I spent several hours researching this issue online and fighting with my fresh install of Win 10 Pro x64 and Office 365 Pro Plus x86 (2016) before opening a support request. The support rep was very helpful and professional; he knew exactly what the issue was and had me fixed in minutes. Had the Office 365 software download page, Office 365 installer, Win 10 (Creator Update) OneDrive or Microsoft&#39;s online documentation pointed me to the answer to begin with, I could have save a lot of my time and the support personnel&#39;s time this morning.\n",

If OneNote for Windows 10 requires a OneDrive account, it should be advertised as such. Also, the error messages in OneNote for Windows 10 should reflect that. This problem was a huge waste of my time and of yours that could have been prevented if OneNote for Windows 10 had error messages that state it needs a OneDrive account to work and/or if the OneNote for Windows 10 documentation had statet that. Please contact the OneNote team and ask them to coordinate with the Office365 team to fix this bug so that you, Microsoft frontline support, aren’t being asked this question over and over again and others' people time is not wasted.

However, Jay gave me a method of resolving this issue in the future if we ever encounter it again. Thank you! Mohammed Tabish was very helpful and patient. I was confused on a few parts and he took the time to walk me through it, repeating himself at times until I understood. I appreciated that high level of customer service. Thank you so much. My current understanding is that I can create quarantine rules for email messages and attachments, which sends the Office 365 admin an email notification of the quarantined items. The admin then has the option of previewing the email and/or downloading any attachments to see if they are relevant/non-malicious files. The admin can then decide to delete or remove from quarantine, making the attached file(s) available to the recipient. Fantastic Support! The person I spoke with was very polite, helpful and knowledgeable. The solution they recommended worked straight-away. Thank you very, very much. He was very patient and helpful. Answered almost all of my questions very thoroughly. Andrew was fantastic! I couldn't ask for a better support experience. The solution was immediately obvious, so he was kind enough to schedule a call back after he had a chance to perform some research. He called back with-in 15 minutes, I think and walked me through an acceptable work around that I will be using from now on when I need to move/copy Notebook Sections and Pages to another Notebook in a different site or tenant. Thank you again! Excellent customer support! Ken was able to pin point the problem very quickly and provide a precise and workable solution. Thank you so much! I couldn't ask for a better support experience. support was excellent. Thank you so much! Excellent support. He went above on beyond. I was most worried about analyzing the email and headers to see if it was a spoof or an actual hacked account. This tech spotted it as a spoof straight away and helped me add some CNAME records to enable DKIM in all 3 of our tenants to help add that little bit of extra security. Thank you so much! I couldn't ask for a better tech support experience. Cheers! Jay, was fantastic! Give this man a raise! Mark L. provided excellent customer service and technical support. His patience, persistence and expert knowledge were a huge asset in trying to resolve this issue. Thank you so much for the help. I learned a lot throughout this process. Quick and easy. This support tech was very helpful and did not give up. It was a very confusing issue, but they were able to stick with it and help me sort it out. I learned a lot in the process and it answered a few outstanding questions I had beyond the immediate support ticket issue. I am very grateful for their outstanding help! Excellent customer service. Thank you so much! The items were there the whole time, it was just the numbering scheme that was showing differently on File Explorer vs. SharePoint Online and the mobile apps. Thanks again! Excellent customer service! Very friendly, and helpful and quick!. Their great attitude made such a difference in removing stress and providing confidence that they would find a solution to my problem. One of the better experiences I've had working with Office 365 tech support, and that's saying something, because I generally have great tech support experiences. Thank you again! Excellent support. He confirmed my thoughts on creating a new Outlook profile. He got right to the heart of the problem in only a few minutes, which I really appreciated. Thank you! Andrew was exceptional! Great service, friendly, extremely professional and knowledgeable AND solved my issue. I couldn't ask for a better tech support experience. I highly recommend Andrew gets a bonus and/or raise. In this frothy job market companies have to work to retain top talent, am I right?! Fantastic customer service. I couldn't ask for a better experience! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Excellent tech support. My issue was solved quickly. Their troubleshooting ability was exceptional. Thank you so much! . I did not realize that deleting contacts in the default Android Contacts app also deletes those contacts from my Outlook Contacts if they were syncing from Outlook.

The solution I was looking for was not available. However, the support service was very knowledgeable, polite and cheerful. I will be posting a feature request in the &quot;User Voice&quot; for Office 365 as soon as I receive the follow-up email. Thank you again! Excellent customer support. Very patient and helpful. Excellent customer service. I was under a ton of pressure from my project management team to make OneDrive and SharePoint more performant or move to another platform. Esan was very calm and professional and knowledgeable and helped confirm that OneDrive and SharePoint were working correctly and even helped brainstorm some ideas to increase the performance and user experience (prioritize OneDrive traffic on our network, increase bandwidth from ISP, increase memory on available workstations and laptops, etc...) Thank you, thank you, thank you. Great customer service. Solved my problem. Very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you! Excellent tech support! He was extremely patient and knowledgeable. He walked me through both this issue and my other open ticket on MFA, app passwords, and desktop Office 365 apps. Very happy with the level of support I received. Excellent service. Thank you so much for taking the extra time to walk me through the possible security vulnerabilities and best-practices that I can propose and implement. The service was very helpful. However, I was very disappointed to learn that SharePoint document libraries with custom metadata, content-types, and columns/views won't correctly sync locally except for read-only. I would have expected OneDrive to be able to sync these like basic, out-of-the-box document libraries. Excellent response and help. I ended up copying and pasting the information from the site page in one tenant to the site page in the other tenant while we were working through the options on the phone call. The articles that the tech support emailed, however, will be helpful in future, more complicated migrations. Thank you so much! Saravan Khumar was excellent! Very helpful, knowledgeable and extremely patient. He even attempted to troubleshoot an issue I was having with auto-replies being sent while driving and using Bluetooth. He went above and beyond. I sincerely appreciate his help. This was excellent support. Concise, to the point, and solved my issue. Great work! The tech support individual was very helpful and solved the problem. I appreciated their patience and their willingness to let me explain the problem fully. The issue appears to have been a cache issue in the Outlook client. Once we cleared that setting in Options ] Mail ] Send Messages ] Empty Auto-Complete List, the problem seemed to be resolved. Problem resolved itself. But the gentleman who called was very kind. And the call was very prompt from when I created support ticket. Thank you.\n",

      "Your Agent was extremely helpful at finding workarounds to get around the limitations of Office 365.  Over yesterday and today he has spent well over two hours which is very much appreciated.  However, if Microsoft had properly addressed the needs of data protection in the UK, none of this would have been necessary.  What is needed is the ability to control who can see the GAL and the other Global Lists.  This is essential to comply with the law but it cannot be done without the convoluted workarounds your agent has helped me with. Because of the long queue the call was late and we did not have enough time to resolve the issue. I have contacted Help several times in the last few days.  The biggest problem is poor quality of sound which is often muffled and indistinct. The agent did not have sufficient knowledge to be able to help.

David, the support engineer was very helpful.  However, the core issue remains.  While I have 1,000 GB of storage on my Office 365 Business Premium subscription, I am only using 5 GB but have exceeded the 20,000 item  sync limit for my OneDrive library.  This is preventing me from syncing any more documents rendering 995 GB of my allocated storage unusable.  This is a classic bait and switch scheme that should be beyond Microsoft to market to its customers.  Either raise the sync limit to some reasonable level or pay me 20 cents per gigabyte month for the unusable storage I am paying for. Andrea is quite knowledgeable and personable.  She exhibits great patience in working with me to resolve my issues.  She is very professional and a model for excellent service. Carefully diagnosed the problem and walked through fix in a thorough and professional manner. I was very fortunate to get Hardeep to address my issue.  She is quite knowledgeable, personable, and patient in dealing with customers. - all the characteristics that make her a model for this very demanding position.  While my underlying issue was with G Suite email and not a Microsoft problem, she nonetheless exhibited the patience to carefully diagnose the cause and steer me to successful resolution.  Having dealt with many support individuals, overall I am impressed with the quality of training and professionalism shown by the Microsoft team.  However, in my view, Hardeep is quite a stand out and Microsoft should be very grateful to have an employee of her stature.  As a manager myself who had thousands of employees reporting to me, I would hire her in a heartbeat.  She has great potential for advancement and management should giver her every opportunity to let her demonstrate what she can do.  I suggest management give her a raise to keep her as she will be in high demand. Austin has done a spectacular job in resolving my issue.  He is quite knowledgeable, professional, and personable.  A top rate support person that should be a model for HP. My engineer, Mohkan, is very knowledgeable and professional.  He was able to diagnose the troubles and take corrective action.

      "Arvic was able to help us figure out what the technician had me do that was wrong. Note, he is the 4th technician I've worked with the 1st, 3rd and Arvic all did great. The 2nd technician I think it was Umar or something like that really screwed me up. He had me stop syncing, start syncing, disconnect, reconnect over and over so many times over an hour that I was lost and just clicking where he said to. The things he had me do took my local drive from 20% full to over 85% full and now I'll need to spend hours trying to fix it. But Arvic gave me some good ideas on how to make sure I'm only deleting duplicates. Jay was very helpful, he resolved my first issue and helped with a couple of smaller issues too. Umer was verry focused on what was wrong and I clicked on the wrong thing duplicating my OneDrive contents so now I have 2 copies of everything! I'll need to delete the duplicates, but at least the issue I called about has been resolved. Mikko was able to fix the first issue and went on to get a data migration started as well. I&#39;ll need to call back to complete it, due to the length of time it will take, but his help was greatly appreciated. Kuldip was unfamiliar with the problems I was experiencing, but he owned the problem and was able to resolve all the issues except one. AND that one was an issue with GoDaddy&#39;s help page having outdated information. So I&#39;ll need to call them, but Kuldip went the extra mile and I&#39;m very impressed. In the past, some of your technicians have simply said call GoDaddy and of course, GoDaddy says call Microsoft. But Kuldip found what I need to ask GoDaddy so they can&#39;t just point their fingers at you. Excelent work. Tom was very helpful and resolved, not only the issue I called about but a couple of additional issues as well. Mark did a great job. I've had a few people work on this from both 3dcart and Microsoft and he figured it out right away. He was easy to understand and most importantly, it works and it only took a few minutes after spending over an hour with others without success. It&#39;s fixed, but we aren&#39;t sure what was causing the issue. Hopefully, it doesn&#39;t reoccur. Neil was great, I initially tried to resolve this issue, which was affecting both my home and business account, by contacting the home tech support. But the first technician had me try some things which didn&#39;t work and when I called in again the second tech was clueless. Fortunatly, she transfered me to Neil and I explained the issues to him. Neil imediatly understood and quickly resolved the issue. While we were waiting to verify that the solution was working, a sync issue with OneDrive, he helped me with a number of other issues. Awesome job. Most of your Business techs are great! And Neil is one of them. David was very helpful and resolved my issues quickly. Patrick did a great job. He helped me with several additional issues while working on the reason for my help request. He&#39;s very easy to understand and knowledgeable. When he didn&#39;t know the answer, he quickly found the answers within a few minutes. Daisy didn't know the answer as she was more experience with windows that MacOS, but she owned the problem and working together we found a solution from a web search and it worked. Rafi Azad did a great job fixing problems from prior technicians. He owned the issues, even though he wasn&#39;t the one who gave me incorrect information. We were able to resolve all the issues I called about and more. I was able to resolve my issue, plus, I learned several new things that will help avoid problems in the future. The technician provided a simple solution to a sync issue I had, but that couldn&#39;t find an answer to in FAQ. Robin did what he could, but the technician that messed this up days ago really screwed my system up. For days now, onedrive has been deleting files on my system and duplicating them at the same time... I noticed the problem because files I edited today are gone, replaced by files from 7 days ago! Yet my local drive has gone from 200GB to 900GB in the same 7 days, all in duplicate files. How are you going to fix this????? AGAIN this isn't on Robin, it's on the technician from last week. Wayne Allen was very helpful. I was on the phone with someone overseas earlier today and missed a couple of things. He was able to pick up the ball and continue without any hesitation. He also answered several additional questions that came up. Honestly, I used to hate Microsoft Support... The last few calls have been much better. Ankit was knowledgeable and helpful. Hopefully she&#39;s resolved the issue of my messages being marked as spam. NOTE: the previous technician never closed the ticket, even though it was finished. So these two tickets are run together. Shahroz was great. He helped me resolve the issue quickly and was very knowledgable. I&#39;m finally understanding how shared mailboxes and distribution groups work! Excelent help, corrected a lot of misinformation from previous support technicians. Thanks! He was able to help me find a resolution to the problem, that I could not find online. Chris quickly helped me resolve the issue I called about, then sincerely asked if he could help with anthing else. I said yes, I want to... and he showed me a significantly better tool to accomplish my task that I didn't even know was part of Office 365. Thanks!!! Louis was great, straight to the point and resolved my issues! The first technician didn&#39;t know what to do and said he would call me back in 15 to 20 minutes after he did some research. I waited for hours and he never called back. I wish I had received Louis as my tech initially. He&#39;s very knowledgeable and articulate. Jed recognized my problem and was able to guide me step by step on how to fix it. I was unable to find the info online and actually spent longer than it took to fix the problem trying to find an answer. Great job! I should have called earlier! Stephen was very helpful. He started giving me detailed instructions but quickly recognized that I understood most of the steps and only provided help as needed, saving me a lot of time. That&#39;s really helpful. He also listened carefully to my problem and didn&#39;t try to guess and take a standard approach. It&#39;s hard to diagnose a problem with the iPad not syncing, but the tech was very patient. Shelly Zhou was great. We actually worked on multiple problems on my desk top and lap top as well as questions about OWA on my iPad! She corrected a lot of misinformation received from earlier technicians. Thanks so much for your patient and informative help!\n",

They did not know how to do it, even though I stated what I wanted in my ticket. Very helpful! He listened to my needs carefully and gave me very helpful and professional advice. He was able to solve my issues with billing inquiries and also help me to get started with Office 365 Business Premium free trial.

      "After investigating the issue in detail, we came to the conclusion this is not possible due to technical limitations of OneDrive.

Furthermore, &quot;add to my OneDrive&quot; only appears on Personal accounts and the &quot;Sync&quot;  button only appears if the folder is hosted within the user&#39;s Office 365 domain.

Right now it&#39;s not completely clear to me whether I will be able to get later the 25TB that I was also promised, because you&#39;ve made a point of obfuscating this information as much as possible.

      "Com vagar e cuidado chegamos a solução que deu fim ao problema de bloqueio no carregamento de arquivos aos usuários. Infelizmente o OneDrive é deficiente em gerenciar uma pasta em rede, conforme informações dadas pelo suporte técnico. O que, a meu sentir é inadmissível, mesmo porque o programa roda na própria plataforma do sistema operacional Windows. Isso posto, o atendimento do suporte foi bom, pois, elucidou a questão. Mas o OneDrive for Business é uma piada, de empresarial não tem nada, pois, esse tipo de demanda é inerente à qualquer empresa que possui um servidor de arquivos e deseja disponibilizá-los na nuvem. PÉSSIM SOLUÇÃO, NÃO RECOMENDO! Não me dei por satisfeito, seria ilógico o OneDrive não funcionar em uma pasta local do servidor de arquivos. E foi justamente essa a diferença. De fato, o programa não consegue mapear pastas de rede. Porém, se o usuário compartilhar uma pasta local, eureca, funciona! O apoio moral do Mauro foi decisivo, apesar que fui eu, usuário que descobri o problema, tratava-se dos privilégios de acesso à pasta compartilhada. É isso prezados, até a próxima!\n",

The technician walked me through everything I need to get this working again. It seems there were some settings we changed on the domain side and then I had to update my office365 password because it expired. I did not know my Office365 password would ever expire. Anyways, the tech was SO helpful and so patient with me even when I had a visitor come by while we were in the middle of debugging my problem. Every time I call MS support they do whatever necessary to fix my issue. This time was no different. SO impressed with MS support. Thank you thank you thank you!!Chris Luna was fantastic! I always get absolute incredible help from this service. Luna helped me to understand intricacies of OneDrive and OneNote storage, both personal and corporate accounts and where my local copies of the files live. I can&#39;t say enough about Luna and this service. &#10;Thank you and best regards,&#10;Chris\n",

He very quickly resolved our problem and was very professional, nice and thorough. Would be happy to work with him again! Apparently, I had already fixed the problem, but there was a delay in users receiving the quarantined emails. Priyanka was very helpful in confirming that I had done all of the right things.

      "The tech was awesome. The Office 365 technician was able to find a work around to sharing the contents of the users OneDrive. It would be beneficial if all the folders and files in an users OneDrive could be shared in a 1 click process with another user vs. a folder by folder basis. When we off-board users we need to be able share the users OneDrive files with their manager. The Microsoft technicians support was excellent. I ran into a technical issue with the Exchange Connector. I setup a whitelist for the remote site IP address; however, Exchange would not accept an anonymous connection from my LOB application. Consequently, I had to create an Exchange only account with MFA and app password to authenticate with smtp.office365.com. I did update my SPF records also, but that did not resolve the issue of using an anonymous account. I would have desired a configuration without using a named user, since I now incur a monthly cost to send messages from an application. The support technician rocked.... The phone support was great, but the online documentation was not accurate. I tried to install the EAC Powershell module and it failed. The reason that it failed was that you have to use Internet Explorer vs. Chrome. The documentation did not state that the IE or Windows browser had to be used. I discovered this from other online postings. She rocked!!!\n",

      "Nice Result Excellent performance and Jay was extremely helpful and knowledgible about many aspects of my situation and was accomodating and very precise in his management of the solution and the overall call. This was a difficult and convoluted problem that required a great deal of detailed examination. I appreciate the dedicated effort made by all three of the technicians who assisted me through this conceptual and technical &#39;nightm....&#39;, Imean, experience.&#10;Thanks very much This ticket was successfully concluded because the support technician was able to demonstrate the correct manner of storing onenote files in the portal.office.com tenant. &#10;however, the problem has been long-standing for me because the difference between the manner of storage for OneNote files is significantly different from the manner of storage for other primary Office 365 applications, such as word and excel, which are file based.&#10;The fact that  OneNote files must be managed by OneNote on both ends of the channel to the cloud and should not be synced through OneDrive is something that should be made clear in those irritating &#39;welcome to&#39; wizards that pop up when you install windows. having to mess with onenote for a couple of years, sometimes for hours at a time, to be able to get to the point where I finally come to believe I am missing an explanation is a really impractical result of microsoft believing that this basic fact is &#39;too technical&#39; for users. Most users would want to kno This gentleman did an excellent job of research on an obstinate problem that helped me to undertand and be able to proceed with the issue of being unable to locate the export feature in the onenote 2016 and onenote app combination. excellent and precise service! This was exceptional help for me since the problem was fundamentally simple, but the available information was exclusively procedural, not conceptual.
